      <title>UI Tests: The Illusion of Quality at the Cost of Quality</title>
      <link>https://zararsiddiqi.com/ui-tests-the-illusion-of-quality/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;UI-based tests are often the de facto method of verifying software correctness in many organizations. It involves deploying the software, making sure all the integration points are hooked up, and then having people attack the UI using tests cases that were developed (often in isolation) to ensure the software meets specification. &lt;a href=&#34;https://testing.googleblog.com/2015/04/just-say-no-to-more-end-to-end-tests.html&#34;&gt;Much has been written about&lt;/a&gt; the downside of this approach which ends up resulting in slow and brittle tests. It is the main reason why &lt;a href=&#34;https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestPyramid.html&#34;&gt;automation pyramids&lt;/a&gt; suggest that UI-based tests be the smallest number of tests written in a suite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond being brittle, unreliable and slow, the major problem with UI-based tests is that they simply don’t test enough combinations. Consider the following rather generic example of an architecture. It is a case where a browser interacts with the UI (written in a framework like React) and the React app calls a service layer which in-turn, calls other services or databases to eventually return a response to the user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://zararsiddiqi.com/images/generic-architecture.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/images/generic-architecture.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a user performs an action (red line), there are seven different integrations that produce the results (green lines). It is along these green lines that most bugs exist, not on the red one. Yet we erroneously use the red line to instrument tests for the system. The goal is to attack the green lines efficiently while having a repeatable regression test suite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The information a user submits can result in different combinations and variations of the green lines being invoked. In the best case scenario where we don’t care about order of calls or repetitive calls, the number of cases to test all combinations could be calculated using the “n choose k” approach:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
n!/k!(n-k)!
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Number of green lines invoked with each user action&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Number of tests needed&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;21&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;35&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;35&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;21&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above table does not even account for variations between two components! For example, if one component sends a status code to another and returns a response, and there are five different status codes possible with five different responses, this would blow up the above counts by multiple orders of magnitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating “prep data” for UI tests in these situations can be a months-long effort and can easily be avoided while increasing quality. For each test case we have to setup the right data in a deployed environment so we’re updating datastores that need to be constantly maintained which is a costly endeavour requiring inter-team communication (a great example of dependencies killing autonomy). If you have been through this exercise even once, you know it is a nightmare. It is unreasonable to think that this strategy can scale to beyond the simplest cases. And we haven’t even talked about speed and stability of these tests which will be woeful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An alternate approach is to not rely on the UI to invoke the variations to test, but push them down to the actual components. Let’s consider this scenario which falls in the “Services” group in the above diagram (i.e., three different components to check each time, let’s not even worry about the UI components right now):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The user enters the number of US Dollars they want to convert to Bitcoin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The system checks if the amount is greater than $1000 and if so, call a frauds checking service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Award the user loyalty points (1 point for every $100 dollars converted), none for less than that&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Send a confirmation email if their settings have them enabled&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a reasonable workflow for testing the above:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capture the request/response payloads from the three different services &lt;em&gt;once&lt;/em&gt; and store them as part of our test suite&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hand-modify each payload to replicate different cases.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For example for the first requirement, mock the response from a service in the following cases to see if your calling component handles it appropriately:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Greater than $1000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Under $1000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Less than $1000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;null&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Empty string&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not a number&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10000000000000000000000000000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the second requirement, it might be:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Greater than $100&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Less than $100&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$100&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the third requirement, it might be
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Email is present, setting is off&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Email is present, setting is on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Email is not present, setting is off&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Email is not present, setting is on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create “unit” level tests which invoke combinations of the above at blazing speed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that many of the tests cases above are not possible to run through the UI since UI-validation would prevent the services from being invoked, leaving services code potentially untested. In general, failure cases are harder to assert using the UI since the UI is designed to provide graceful experiences. Failures are often hidden behind more generic error messages so validating failure type is difficult through the UI but easy from the component level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above approach is not a technical challenge but an organizational one. Companies are wired to offload quality to specific roles like QA, who end up writing automation suites at the UI level where it’s impossible to provide the requisite quality. The better approach is to have QA work with developers and ask them “what if” questions which end up resulting in strong and comprehensive test suites. In the above example, QA might ask questions like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if the user doesn’t have a USD bank account?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if the user has a previous fraudulent transaction?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if the services that provides the current value of Bitcoin is unavailable?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The developer can then use this information to simulate payloads and ensure the application has the right tests. This does not mean that UI tests go away, they are instead used to ensure the application is stable and running, rather than functionally correct. This reduces the UI tests needed from the hundreds to a handful. Exploratory testing (&lt;a href=&#34;https://less.works/papers/et.pdf&#34;&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;) is another method to identify quality issues from the user’s perspective, with output from exploratory testing used to inform what unit tests to write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This model of working requires QA to impart knowledge to developers, who then codify this knowledge as part of the codebase. It requires the two roles to work closely together rather than developers heaving code over the wall for QA to test, thus starting the long and painful process of fix-deploy-retest. The greater challenge here may simply be the mindset that UI tests are somehow more “real” than unit tests - they’re not. They provide the illusion of quality without poking into the details of how the various interconnected components work together to deliver a user experience. Most bugs live at the seams of a system and there is nothing better than unit tests to uncover them efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>5 Story Mapping Anti-Patterns</title>
      <link>https://zararsiddiqi.com/story-mapping-anti-patterns/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 21 Apr 2022 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://zararsiddiqi.com/story-mapping-anti-patterns/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://zararsiddiqi.com/images/user-story-map.png&#34; alt=&#34;&amp;amp;ldquo;User Story Map&amp;amp;rdquo;&#34;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.beliminal.com/quickstart-guide-to-user-story-maps/&#34;&gt;beliminal.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jpattonassociates.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/story_mapping.pdf&#34;&gt;Story Mapping&lt;/a&gt; can be a valuable planning exercise which can help prioritize work while centering the conversation on the customer. It can help a team align on an MVP, create releases, identify dependencies, prioritize stories, and generally lean out the product. It does this by bringing about a multitude of opinions and ideas in how to deliver value to the customer, and having a healthy discussion around the possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having seen many story maps in the wild, I&amp;rsquo;ve compiled a list of 5 anti-patterns to avoid when using story maps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;creating-them-in-isolation&#34; &gt;Creating them in isolation
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#creating-them-in-isolation&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If one or two people are going away and creating a story map on their own and then presenting it to the team, it is sure to be an unmitigated disaster. There is a strong anchoring bias in these situations and the team will treat the story map as a concrete artifact rather than a pliable one. Even though the effort may be well-intentioned, the team will feel that the major decisions have already been made and that they&amp;rsquo;re being told what the plan is, not asked what it should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to do instead:&lt;/strong&gt; Create the story map from scratch with the full team present with the help of an experienced facilitator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;creating-a-wbs-instead&#34; &gt;Creating a WBS instead
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#creating-a-wbs-instead&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is easy to fall into the trap of identifying the work you&amp;rsquo;re doing in a hierarchical format, and just label the hierarchies Themes, Epics and Stories. This is a big mistake because the story we are telling in a story map is about the user. It is from the user&amp;rsquo;s perspective that we have to look at the interactions, and then decide what work to do to enable that interaction. If we skip the part about centering on the user, then we are essentially creating a WBS. This may help us organize what needs to be done, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t help us see the customer value of the work we have to do since it is not tied to a user&amp;rsquo;s behavior. This also hurts prioritization as we have little context where the user impact of the work we&amp;rsquo;re doing can be discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to do instead:&lt;/strong&gt; Start by identifying the users (or personas) of the product and outlining the main interactions you anticipate them having with the product. Then talk about what&amp;rsquo;s needed to enable those interactions. Then think about the simplest way to enable those interactions (i.e., your MVP).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;not-cutting-releases&#34; &gt;Not cutting releases
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#not-cutting-releases&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the main benefits of using a story map is that it visualizes all the work to be done. However, we don&amp;rsquo;t want to actually do ALL the work but only the highest value work. Story mapping enables this by using horizontal lines to demarcate releases, i.e., groups of prioritized functionality that is sequentially delivered and aims to enable the customer interactions we want. Ultimately, we want to end up in a position where a lot of the work on the story map remains undone while delivering sufficient value through the work that was done. To do this we must incrementally deliver value, and without explicitly cutting releases it becomes a big bang approach*.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to do instead:&lt;/strong&gt; Identify the stories that you want to deliver first by carving out a release. While working on those stories, avoid working on anything below the release line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Unless you&amp;rsquo;re in a continuous delivery environment where stories are sent to production when they&amp;rsquo;re done. In those situations, cutting releases becomes less important as we are getting feedback much more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;jumping-into-jira&#34; &gt;Jumping into Jira
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#jumping-into-jira&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is best to use a brainstorming tool rather than a project management tool to create story maps. The Story Mapping Jira Plugin may be one of the saddest things I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen in software development. Electronic tooling works well when story mapping remotely but a tool that allows for quick and easy change of story mapping items (e.g., releases, stories, ideas, thoughts, dependencies) is essential. Changing, reordering, deleting, and creating new items in Jira is a slower and much more painful process than doing it in a tool like Mural.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to do instead:&lt;/strong&gt; Use a brainstorming tool, and only when the team has decided what stories to implement, shift them to the project management tool in small batches (don&amp;rsquo;t bring EVERYTHING into Jira). We are trying to maximize the amount of work NOT done while delivering sufficient value, so keep the things you don&amp;rsquo;t intend to work on in the near-term outside of Jira or else they become a form of waste that you have to deal with every time you look at your backlog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;staying-married-to-your-stickies&#34; &gt;Staying married to your stickies
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#staying-married-to-your-stickies&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just because it made sense to a sticky to exist at some point, doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean it should still exist. Team conversations around a story map should result in addition, deletion and editing of the stickies on the board. There is a tendency to add stickies to the story map while keeping useless ones &amp;ldquo;just in case&amp;rdquo;. This is not a good approach and can result in proliferation of stickies that don&amp;rsquo;t have much value, and adds confusion to the map by making it unnecessarily verbose and large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to do instead:&lt;/strong&gt; Tear up the sticky if the team doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel it&amp;rsquo;s relevant anymore. If that is too scary of a proposition, create a separate area somewhere (like a story map Recycle Bin) to dump them there just for your own psychological safety. But do take it off the story map so you don&amp;rsquo;t look at the same sticky over and over again, and wonder what it means three times a week. That is wasteful.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Simple Practices to Improve Software Development Teams</title>
      <link>https://zararsiddiqi.com/simple-practices-to-improve-software-development-team/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://zararsiddiqi.com/simple-practices-to-improve-software-development-team/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This assumes a team where we have the following roles: Product Owner, Developers, Quality Assurance and a Business Analyst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;qa-tests-from-the-same-spec-as-developers&#34; &gt;QA tests from the same spec as developers
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#qa-tests-from-the-same-spec-as-developers&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever verification QA does should already have been done by developers. 95% of things that QA checks should not be undergoing a test for the first time, but developers should have already checked it. The remaining 5% are exceptions and should ultimately be reduced to 0%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to achieve this is to get a common language between developers and QA by having them write the acceptance criteria, and this not be an exclusive responsibility of the BA or PO. Both developers and QA will check the AC to mark completeness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have developers show how the software meets the acceptance criteria before committing/deploying code&lt;/strong&gt;
Avoid the practice of committing code, waiting for it to deploy somewhere, and then QA reviewing it. This makes the test-fix-test cycle extremely inefficient. Developers should pair with QA during the story to verify that they meet AC. This should be done locally (e.g., on &lt;code&gt;localhost&lt;/code&gt;) before any costs related to deployments, check-ins are incurred. 95% of defects will be found at this stage.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resist the tendency to rush through planning by only discussing and understanding what the requirements are. Have a thorough discussion on how a story will be tested. There is a tendency to use a manual UI-based end-to-end test to verify every story by default. This is wasteful as end-to-end tastes are inefficient (e.g., data setup, deployment) and slow to run. For example, if we&amp;rsquo;re making a content change on the UI, it only requires verification on &lt;code&gt;localhost&lt;/code&gt; and nothing more. Or if a service changes how it validates a date, a unit test for it is more than sufficient, we don&amp;rsquo;t need an E2E test for this minor change. We have to balance the cost of the test versus the risk of something going wrong. That risk is best mitigated through unit testing, not E2E testing.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reducing queue size is a good practice everywhere, but especially if a team has decided to have a separate testing column for QA or PO. Avoid the tendency to wait for more things to be &amp;ldquo;dev complete&amp;rdquo; before you test. This has the effect of delaying feedback, which means you find bugs later in the iteration and rush through things the last couple days of a sprint. Instead, install a Work in Process limit on this column to something small (like 2) meaning that we never put more than 2 items in this column. This will have the effect of the team getting more stuff to &amp;lsquo;done&amp;rsquo; earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avoid the tendency to treat all things in the sprint with the same level of importance. Just like we sequence the work in the Product Backlog, the same has to be done in a Sprint Backlog. This ensures we get maximum value out of the sprint and don&amp;rsquo;t inadvertently defer high value items to later in the sprint.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of the three traditional stand-up questions (what you did, what you will do, any blockers), run the standup by going through each item from right to left, with right being the stuff that&amp;rsquo;s closest to get done. This ensures that you&amp;rsquo;re talking first about finishing work than starting work. The work on the right side of the board will always be more important than on the left because if you prioritize your sprint backlog properly, the important work will start first as well. This also ensure that we talk through all the work that&amp;rsquo;s in progress.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We may discuss a lot about the work to be done in planning, but that is not where planning ends. The team will undoubtedly discover new things during the sprint and the PO has to be available to clarify acceptance criteria, potentially reduce scope, provide business context etc. during the sprint. Open office hours right after stand-up for the PO every day where the team can show him or her progress and ask for clarifications is critical to resolving impediments.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reviewing code is a great way to learn about the application you&amp;rsquo;re working on. Don&amp;rsquo;t deprive your teammates of this knowledge by only having select people be responsible for reviewing PRs. Where possible (and it&amp;rsquo;s usually possible everywhere), do group PR reviews where the person submitting the PR walks their teammates through what they are doing. This maximizes the communication and information being shared, resulting in everyone learning something and improving themselves. Want to go a step further? Use Pair Programming. The only thing more effective than Pair Programming is Mob Programming.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The design is an informed opinion on a solution. It must not be treated as a requirement. The POs job is not to simply chop up the design into smaller stories. It is to critically think about what aspects of the design are important. For example, if you are implementing a table which shows your recent credit card purchases and there are 10 fields for which to search across, the PO should not blindly implement all 10, but think about which three are the most important and then weigh the remaining 7 against what else is in the backlog. If we do this meticulously and consistently, the development effort will reduce by 50% while still delivering 95% of value.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If QA finds a defect for a story in the sprint they should reach out to the developer directly and address the defect together. Don&amp;rsquo;t create JIRA tickets to communicate with your team on these occasions. Defects can only be created on things that are actually done. In this case the story is still in progress.  Creating JIRA tickets to reflect defects for in-sprint work creates a needless communication barrier and generates a tremendous amount of waste, while discouraging team communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a team where everyone trusts each other your word means something. When you say something is done, expect your teammates to take your word for it. You do not need to attach documents, screenshots etc. to &amp;ldquo;prove&amp;rdquo; that you have tested the story. The story&amp;rsquo;s automated test cases written by developers (e.g., JUnit) are enough. Nobody usually looks at these attachments in Jira anyway since POs verify things by using the software instead of checking screenshots of how someone else used it. This can save QA time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are using feature branches, either merge your feature branch to the main line daily OR update your feature branch from the main line daily. If you do neither, you&amp;rsquo;re asking for trouble by delaying integration. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if you use &lt;code&gt;git rebase&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;git merge&lt;/code&gt; to do this, but the delta between main line and feature branch should not exceed a single day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If any story is taking more than 2-3 days to go across the board, the story is either too big or the developer/team needs help implementing it faster. Pairing (two developers or working on it together) or mobbing (3 or more people looking at it together) is the way to go. This will 100% get things done faster even though it may sounds like a waste of having too many people working on one story. There is no doubt about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defects should be discussed by the team and specifically the question, &amp;ldquo;How do we prevent this in the future?&amp;rdquo; needs to be asked for all defects.  The main principle to keep in mind when solving for this is to find defects at the earliest stage possible, i.e., &amp;ldquo;shift left&amp;rdquo;. This can be done using test-driven development, pair testing, focus on unit testing over E2E, involving PO/business partners early (during &amp;ldquo;in development&amp;rdquo; phase, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Integration tests are a subset of unit tests. Unit testing should account for upwards of 90% of all quality controls (not end to end manual testing). To test the behaviour of your code which accesses downstream system, capture a real response and store it to file. Then create variations of that file to simulate other expected responses from the downstream service. Assert that the code behaves correctly for all these responses in the integration tests. WireMock is a great tool for this.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is tempting to initialize Spring context to setup your test. This is usually slow and not needed as you can use Mockito and mock out the dependencies of your classes without incurring the performance overhead of spring in your tests. For example, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to rely on Spring to inject a  &lt;code&gt;@Autowired&lt;/code&gt; variable. You can simply mock it using &lt;code&gt;Mockito.mock()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feature Toggles are an excellent mechanism for deploying more frequently and reducing the risk of having multiple branches hanging around. They allow you to release in small batches, reducing the overall risk of the work. However, as more functionality is completed, they become redundant and need to be deleted. If they&amp;rsquo;re not taken out, they become a form of technical debt.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Leading Indicators</title>
      <link>https://zararsiddiqi.com/leading-indicators-avoid-analytics-fatigue/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 20 Nov 2021 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://zararsiddiqi.com/leading-indicators-avoid-analytics-fatigue/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are two main types of indicators that we use to measure products. The most common method is to build something and then measure how effective the product was at achieving its goals. These are lagging indicators because they&amp;rsquo;re only available once the investment in the product has happened and its built to a degree where it&amp;rsquo;s available to users. Thus they are expensive. The second method is focusing on metrics which can predict whether what you&amp;rsquo;re thinking about building is viable. These are leading indicators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are familiar with lagging indicators with common ones being daily active users, revenue, products sold etc. However, leading indicators are a little more nuanced. Take for example an interior decoration application that allows you to see how a space looks like with different types of furniture. A leading indicator which might indicate success could be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many new houses are being purchased in a city?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many ads are being posted for interior decoration services on Kijiji?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does Google Trends say about the keyword &amp;ldquo;design room with furniture online&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More specific to the software, leading indicators that A/B tests could answer are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having been prompted with the value proposition, how many visitors click on &amp;ldquo;Learn more&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Would people download free designs or want to customize their own?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What percentage of people want to speak with a designer compared to those who want to try the application?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading indicators can provide great insight at a fraction of the cost of lagging indicators, yet we rarely talk about them during product inception, and even less while developing. One big reason is that we are conditioned to not think about leading metrics because of the ease of which data can be collected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analytics tools like Google Analytics have made it so easy to integrate and track large amounts of user data that it has had an unforeseen effect: instead of teams using these tools to apply analytical rigour, there is a tendency to &amp;ldquo;integrate and forget&amp;rdquo;. After all, if you&amp;rsquo;re collecting EVERYTHING the user does, why bother spending time thinking about what you&amp;rsquo;re collecting?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In economic terms, the cost of measuring everything is so low that we measure everything but analyze little. Just by adding a line of JavaScript in an application we now have troves of data at our fingertips. It&amp;rsquo;s tempting to leave it at this and later figure out what data we actually need to analyze. This approach has two main problems. First, it diminishes the importance of the team having a conversation about exactly what behaviour they are trying to optimize for. Having a hypothesis of user behaviour is a critical activity which positions the team to think about customer behaviour from the start instead of as an afterthought. Second, it floods the team with data without direction on what to look for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do you get a team to have conversations about leading indicators? An easy way is during planning. More specifically, we can come up with leading indicators by hypothesizing the implications of an indicator. For example, if we see a upwards trend in the number of people offering interior design services on Kijiji, we can connect this observation to an A/B test to validate whether people really are looking to design furniture online:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;1. Variation 1: Create a Kijiji ad offering interior design services to see if you get enough calls
2. Variation 2: Create a very similar ad but this one has a link to your website which claims to allow you to design your own space
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If #1 wins then perhaps people want experts to come give them advice. If #2 wins then there may be an appetite for such an application.  Either way, you have only invested the cost of a couple Kijiji ads to gauge interest in the product before committing to an expensive build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is MVP-thinking. We tend to associate MVPs with software releases, but they can be anything that allows us to execute a build-measure-learn cycle. And the &amp;ldquo;build&amp;rdquo; doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be expensive if we utilize leading indicators since they promote cheaper MVPs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using Gherkin for Acceptance Criteria</title>
      <link>https://zararsiddiqi.com/given-when-then-for-acceptance-criteria/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 25 Aug 2021 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://zararsiddiqi.com/given-when-then-for-acceptance-criteria/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had a mixed experience working with &lt;a href=&#34;https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/&#34;&gt;Gherkin&lt;/a&gt; and Cucumber, and the culprit has usually been the step definitions. Consider the following scenario:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;GIVEN the client is logged in
WHEN the client accesses their portfolio
THEN the client sees their balance
AND the client sees an option to transfer funds
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This requires four methods to be declared which implement each step. The implementation of these methods tends to result in UI-tests as that is often the natural way to look at software. Writing unit and component level tests for this scenario requires a discipline that is often lacking. Many developers also see this as overhead and an unnecessary abstraction layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, even if we choose not to use Gherkin to formulate our tests, there is still value in using Gherkin when writing requirements and more specifically, acceptance criteria, especially when writing them for state and workflow management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the following flow for a ticketing management software. After a ticket is created it can go through several different states depending on some business rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://zararsiddiqi.com/images/state-diagram-given-when-then.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&amp;amp;ldquo;State Diagram for Ticketing System&amp;amp;rdquo;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is fairly easy to write Gherkin for these states. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;GIVEN that a user wants to create a ticket
WHEN the ticket is created
THEN the ticket status is set to &amp;#39;Created&amp;#39;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;OR&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;GIVEN that a ticket is in &amp;#39;Under Review&amp;#39; status
WHEN the user approves the ticket   
THEN the ticket is in &amp;#39;Approved&amp;#39; status
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s now layer in some more complex business rules. Let&amp;rsquo;s say that only admin users can approve tickets and and if any other user type tries to approve, an admin is notified. We can write two scenarios for this requirement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;GIVEN that a ticket is in &amp;#39;Under Review&amp;#39; status
WHEN an admin user tries to approve the ticket
THEN the ticket is in &amp;#39;Approved&amp;#39; status
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;GIVEN that a ticket is in &amp;#39;Under Review&amp;#39; status
WHEN a non-admin user tries to approve the ticket
THEN the ticket remains in &amp;#39;Under Review&amp;#39; status
AND the admin user is notified of this attempt to change status
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s now consider a business rule which says that a ticket older than three days which is in Under Review status must immediately be assigned to a supervisor for immediate action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;GIVEN that a ticket is in &amp;#39;Under Review&amp;#39; 
WHEN 72 hours have passed since it was moved to &amp;#39;Under Review&amp;#39;
THEN re-assign ticket to supervisor
AND notify ticket creator that supervisor is looking at it
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s do one more. Say we have a rule that tickets related to &lt;em&gt;Security&lt;/em&gt; can only be worked on by Alice and that if Alice already has three tickets assigned to her, then it must go to Bob.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;GIVEN that a Security ticket is created
AND that Alice has less than three tickets assigned to them
THEN assign the ticket to Alice  
AND set the status to &amp;#39;Created&amp;#39;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;GIVEN that a Security ticket is created
AND that Alice has more than three tickets assigned to them
THEN assign the ticket to Bob  
AND set the status to &amp;#39;Created&amp;#39;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can see that we can layer in all kinds of complex business rules to this workflow without muddying the requirements. The power of the &lt;code&gt;GIVEN&lt;/code&gt; clause allows us to set preconditions on the requirement so that the team knows exactly what case we are dealing with. If we are able to write our requirements using this syntax, it will also help us keep our user stories small because splitting stories would just be a matter of splitting out the acceptance criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though developers may not use Gherkin/Cucumber to write their tests, having the requirements in this format makes it clear what the minimal set of tests they should write.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Backend and Frontend Story Divide</title>
      <link>https://zararsiddiqi.com/backend-frontend-story-divide/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 05 May 2021 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://zararsiddiqi.com/backend-frontend-story-divide/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post I will tackle the idea of splitting user stories based on role, i.e., back-end user story, front-end user story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-and-isnt-a-user-story&#34; &gt;What is and isn&amp;rsquo;t a user story?
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-and-isnt-a-user-story&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To start this discussion we first have to agree on what a user story is. At the highest level, it is an &lt;em&gt;invitation to a conversation&lt;/em&gt;. That conversation is where people (i.e., developers, business people) can examine the value proposition, discuss implementation complexity, evaluate cost/value trade-offs, identify dependencies and come up with a general approach to a solution. Based on this discussion a shared understanding of the requirement is developed which is then written down in some form. These forms could be acceptance criteria, Gherkin, decision tables or if it&amp;rsquo;s simple enough, nothing else is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;User stories are mistakenly associated with the work that is required, not with the capability they enable. One of the benefits of using stories is that it aligns different people towards a shared goal. Instead of breaking up the work in separate, independent streams, the requirement is kept together in  hopes that people collaborate, share knowledge and most importantly, learn about how best to execute together. The user story is not about the creators of the software, it&amp;rsquo;s about the people using the software and that lens should not be compromised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;specialization-and-the-dangers-of-local-optimization&#34; &gt;Specialization and the dangers of local optimization
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#specialization-and-the-dangers-of-local-optimization&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not unreasonable for people to split up and tackle the work independently as well, in which case we usually create tasks, e.g., setup Kafka queue, create schema, generate auth token. Creation of these tasks helps identify the work needed to complete the story and deliver value to the customer. As not everyone can pair or mob on everything together all the time, and given that flow and independence are important, these tasks could be tackled independently. However, that can only happen after a shared understanding of the solution is developed, and integration is kept front and center, which implies that the work for the layers stays together. Divergence to optimize individual work over the larger goal does not help us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The urge to create back-end and front-end stories arises because the level of specialization in the industry has reached a point where there is an implicit mapping between skill-set and architectural layer. Instead of breaking down the work of a simple read operation in small tasks like develop API, authorize token, create table to display, we instead split them apart based on role: front-end and back-end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;rsquo;t do this because it helps us collaborate better or because it&amp;rsquo;s a meaningful distinction. We do it solely because we are wired for local optimization, not system optimization. &lt;em&gt;You do your part, I do my part. We&amp;rsquo;ll worry about whether the whole thing works later.&lt;/em&gt; More cynically, we don&amp;rsquo;t want to talk to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;small-is-good-but-only-if-its-valuable&#34; &gt;Small is good but only if it&amp;rsquo;s valuable
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#small-is-good-but-only-if-its-valuable&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The positive side effect of the story becoming small comes at a huge price of lack of collaboration, lack of knowledge sharing, delayed integration (integration stories anyone?) and most of all, a completed story which doesn&amp;rsquo;t deliver value to the customer (e.g., only the UI is done).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It affects how we approach our work by creating an entirely artificial and continually reinforcing boundary. Instead of a list of tasks needed to finish the work, we first segment it by skill, and then within that skill identify the tasks. And very likely have to later worry about integration of the two layers much later than we should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps we got here by trying to split stories and make them smaller because smaller is generally better. However, at some point we hit a tipping point where smaller no longer meant valuable. As soon as that happens, it&amp;rsquo;s time to hit the reset button and talk about how better to work together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This split also discourages pairing and mobbing because right off the bat we have eliminated the core idea behind such techniques: people sitting together knowledge sharing, reviewing code on-the-go, keeping WIP low and collective code ownership. We have intentionally split people apart with no benefit to gain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The principle of locality is well described in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44333183-the-unicorn-project&#34;&gt;The Unicorn Project&lt;/a&gt; and can mistakenly lend credence to the idea of splitting up work in this manner. The idea behind locality is that people need to be able to develop and get feedback on software without depending on other entities. The more non-localized dependencies (e.g., something you can&amp;rsquo;t stub out), the more integration risk. However, it is a mistake to view other people on your team as a dependency and &amp;ldquo;stub&amp;rdquo; them out by splitting work this way. That only increases and delays the integration effort while putting a ceiling on collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;different-teams-same-goal&#34; &gt;Different teams, same goal
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#different-teams-same-goal&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can argue that kind of splits can be valuable at a higher level when a requirement must done by teams of orthogonal skill sets. For example, a machine learning layer where data scientists want to work on a recommendation engine, while a web developer is responsible for laying out the products on the website. Those are two different teams working on a larger problem, not a split within a team. It is the in-team split that is especially harmful. Even in these situations it is valuable for a story to tie in both pieces of work as stories are about getting a customer perspective, not a vehicle for organizing work within a team - we can use tasks for that and make those tasks small and independently deployable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-if-the-work-only-involves-layer&#34; &gt;What if the work only involves layer?

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the feature being developed is limited to one layer, for example a content update or a change to an algorithm, then the work by it&amp;rsquo;s very nature spans only the &amp;ldquo;frontend&amp;rdquo; or the &amp;ldquo;backend&amp;rdquo;. This post is not a critique on those types of stories, as in those cases the customer gets value on completion of the story. The fact that the work involves a single layer is coincidental.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some things to try if you&amp;rsquo;re struggling organizing the work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take a user story written and &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/comparethemarket/i-did-mob-programming-every-day-for-5-months-heres-what-i-learnt-b586fb8b67c&#34;&gt;mob on it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect the work related to create the story as tasks within a story - make those tasks deployable/releasable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Institute team norms which value learning so instead of avoiding to work on different layers, we strive to learn and become more &amp;ldquo;full stack&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Iterate over a user story with each story adding to the fidelity of the solution, not components of the solution (see image below)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the &lt;a href=&#34;https://gojko.net/2012/01/23/splitting-user-stories-the-hamburger-method/&#34;&gt;Hamburger Method of story splitting&lt;/a&gt; to create slices, not chunking out work into &amp;ldquo;stories&amp;rdquo; that don&amp;rsquo;t enable customer feedback&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Avoiding Duplication in State Management</title>
      <link>https://zararsiddiqi.com/avoiding-duplication-in-state-management/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 04 May 2021 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://zararsiddiqi.com/avoiding-duplication-in-state-management/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;State management is where small bugs grow up to become evil villains, rendering applications a nightmare to maintain. This is especially true when writing JavaScript to maintain UI state. It is tempting to create instance variables which maintain state which are then queried in template logic. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;my-component.ts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;class MyComponent {
    language: string

    constructor(private myStore: MyStore) {}

    changeLanguage(lang: string) {
        // set this.language based on myStore
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;my-component.html&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Language being used is {{ language }}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This type of code is common and should be avoided as it violates the &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.c2.com/?XpSimplicityRules&#34;&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s subtle but the violation comes from having to maintain the value of the language in two places: the store and the component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above makes for wonky tests as well, because we end up doing something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;const component = new MyComponent(store)
expect(component.language).toBeNull()
component.changeLanguage(&amp;#34;en&amp;#34;)
expect(component.language).toBe(&amp;#34;en&amp;#34;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test the effect of &lt;code&gt;changeLanguage()&lt;/code&gt; we are checking a completely different object (&lt;code&gt;language&lt;/code&gt;). That&amp;rsquo;s because the function has side effects of updating component state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A better test would be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;const component = new MyComponent(mockedStore)
component.changeLanguage(&amp;#34;en&amp;#34;)
expect(component.store.changeLanguage).toHaveBeenCalledOnce(&amp;#34;en&amp;#34;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;And after introducing a &lt;code&gt;getLanguage()&lt;/code&gt; which would just query the store, another test might be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;let component = new MyComponent(mockedStore)
component.getLanguage(&amp;#34;en&amp;#34;)
expect(component.store.getLanguage).toHaveBeenCalledOnceWith(&amp;#34;en&amp;#34;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;The store would have its own unit test. This is of course the &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.devgenius.io/detroit-and-london-schools-of-test-driven-development-3d2f8dca71e5&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;London style&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; of TDD. If you are of the Detroit mindset, the test might be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;let component = new MyComponent(realStore)
component.changeLanguage(&amp;#34;en&amp;#34;)
expect(component.getLanguage()).toBe(&amp;#34;en&amp;#34;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this approach we no longer need to maintain component state and our template becomes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;my-component.html&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Language being used is {{ getLanguage() }}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;The side effect of interacting with the store still exists in  &lt;code&gt;changeLanguage()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;getLanguage()&lt;/code&gt; but that is easier to test (thus easier to maintain) than duplicating the value. Having a single source of truth for your state is critical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are cases where we may need to &amp;ldquo;duplicate&amp;rdquo;. Maybe we want to preview the language before saving it which would require two values to be tracked. Even in this situation component level state is not needed. We can store &lt;code&gt;currentLanguage&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;previewLanguage&lt;/code&gt; in a store rather than in the component, with the responsibility of the component mainly being event handling and delegation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/39996759&#34;&gt;Philosophy of Software Design&lt;/a&gt; text, John Ousterhout talks about having smaller interfaces but deep modules, and this approach takes that into account. The interface consisting of &lt;code&gt;getLanguage()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;changeLanguage()&lt;/code&gt; is &amp;ldquo;smaller&amp;rdquo; than dealing with &lt;code&gt;component.language&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;component.changeLanguage()&lt;/code&gt; as the latter isn&amp;rsquo;t even an interface and exposes implementation details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, dealing with the store does add more complexity but it is well-hidden behind a clean interface.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mocking and Spying with Jest and TypeScript</title>
      <link>https://zararsiddiqi.com/mocking-and-spying-jest-typescript/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 22 Apr 2021 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://zararsiddiqi.com/mocking-and-spying-jest-typescript/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have found that the easiest way to mock TypeScript objects using Jest is by simply doing this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;const obj = {
   prop1: &amp;#34;some string prop&amp;#34;,
   prop2: 50
} as any as MyType
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now we can use &lt;code&gt;obj&lt;/code&gt; anywhere &lt;code&gt;MyType&lt;/code&gt;  was expected and can use &lt;code&gt;jest.spyOn(obj, ...)&lt;/code&gt; to the heart&amp;rsquo;s content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frameworks like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-mock-extended&#34;&gt;jest-mock-extended&lt;/a&gt; do similar work but I find that they&amp;rsquo;re an unnecessary abstraction that prevent the test from being expressive and obvious. I like that there&amp;rsquo;s nothing between the mocked object and then test code, and you&amp;rsquo;re able to see the lack of magic explicitly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me a  good test framework should allow you to mock out dependencies easily and the combination of this trick and Jest&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;spyOn&lt;/code&gt; do the trick well enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes,  the &lt;code&gt;as any as&lt;/code&gt; trick is a bit awkward and you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t need the &lt;code&gt;as any&lt;/code&gt; detour, but I will invoke &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/BeckDesignRules.html&#34;&gt;Kent Beck&amp;rsquo;s second rule of simple design&lt;/a&gt;, i.e., reveals intention, and go with it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Evaluating Metrics</title>
      <link>https://zararsiddiqi.com/evaluating-metrics/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 31 Mar 2021 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://zararsiddiqi.com/evaluating-metrics/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Good &lt;a href=&#34;https://continuousdeliverypodcast.buzzsprout.com/883858/8257974-ep-45-evaluating-metrics&#34;&gt;Continous Delivery podcast&lt;/a&gt; where they talked about how to evaluate metrics and their suitability to the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t know how to respond to a metric, don&amp;rsquo;t measure it. This is a quote from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/444653.How_to_Measure_Anything&#34;&gt;How to Measure Anything&lt;/a&gt;) and is a clever way of asking why we need to measure something. If we&amp;rsquo;re not willing to act when we see a metric, what&amp;rsquo;s the point?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there is additional work needed to create the metric and it isn&amp;rsquo;t a natural byproduct of the work, then we have to ask the question whether the effort of creating an observable metric is worth the opportunity cost?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the metic at the right level of granularity? If a team metric is shown to management or vice-versa, what effects will it have? Will it send the wrong signals which can snowball into waste?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the metric measuring output or outcome? Pure ouput metrics like Line of Code are not helpful. Metrics such as subscribers gained or software quality which are outcome-oriented are better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the metric being observed producing the right behavours? If people are incentivized to do the wrong thing by the metric then it&amp;rsquo;s harmful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Shock Doctrine</title>
      <link>https://zararsiddiqi.com/shock-doctrine/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 26 Mar 2021 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://zararsiddiqi.com/shock-doctrine/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The most effective time to impose drastic change on a system is when it is disoriented due to an unexpected shock. During this period events are unfolding faster than information is made available to explain those events, thus leaving people vulnerable to accept any remedy to their condition. With people at their most vulnerable the shock period becomes an invitation for drastic change. The change applied depends on the ideas that are present during the shock. Though these ideas would be considered unconscionable during normal times, the shock period leaves the door ajar for their implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the job of ideologues to have these ideas lying around so that when an opportunity to implement them comes, they are ready. In these brief time periods all may be permitted as democracy is suspended. With people reeling from the shock (e.g., Iraq invasion, military junta takeovers, tsunamis, terrorist attacks), they are not able to assess their own self-interests and are easily susceptible to accept policies and programs which cause them great harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfettered and unchecked &amp;ldquo;capitalism&amp;rdquo; is more akin to cronyism than it is a pure form of capitalism. The latter can work to the people&amp;rsquo;s benefits, the former never does benefit the masses but only a select few. When countries are in shock they are ripe for Chicago School ideologies to implement their policies: privatization, deregulation and cuts to social spending. This effectively results in job losses, selling of national assets at pennies on the dollar, and multinational corporations making massive profits with no trickle-down economic effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When opposed, this ideology is met with fierce economic and physical violence. The IMF, World Bank and other financial entities create &amp;ldquo;rescue&amp;rdquo; plans which lend to distressed countries in exchange for an agreement to implement Chicago School policies, thus crippling societies in the name of rebuilding. Violent implementations of these include Chile, Argentina, Bolivia, Russia, Indonesia and most horrifyingly, Iraq. The direct effect of these forced economic policies is generational poverty and radicalization of youth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is often a hollow state - a phenomenon where the government isn&amp;rsquo;t governing but outsourcing its responsibilities to private entities. In Milton Friedman&amp;rsquo;s utopia the government is seen as a competitor to the private sector and is thus interfering with the free market. The effects of the elimination of the &amp;ldquo;interference&amp;rdquo; leaves the vast majority of the public with little to no protections against price increases or employment opportunities since foreign multinational corporations dominate the landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Waiting for a Crisis</title>
      <link>https://zararsiddiqi.com/waiting-for-a-crisis/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Mar 2021 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://zararsiddiqi.com/waiting-for-a-crisis/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m currently reading The Shock Doctrine by Naomi Klein where she  repaints the impact of US economic influence on South American policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quote from Chicago School economist Milton Friedman:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only a crisis - actual or perceived - produces real change. When that crisis occurs, the actions that are taken depend on the ideas that are lying around. That I believe, is our basic function: to develop alternatives to existing policies, to keep them alive and available until the politically impossible becomes the politically inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a powerful idea that can be applied much more broadly. When  a situation is sufficiently special or unique, the constraints and rules in place can be deemed inadequate to address it. This can give us permission to suspend them without consensus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this period of suspension policies and ideas can be applied without rigorous review, opening the door for what may come. In South America&amp;rsquo;s case what followed was both unfettered capitalism and genocide. For a crisis such as Covid it was innovation and reduction of wasteful value chain activities. Or a fresh look at how to manage social programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of having ideas &amp;ldquo;lying around&amp;rdquo; waiting for the right implementation environment is akin to experimentation which is what fuels innovation. Some theories are so big that they require  special environments and circumstances to be tested out while others have ready playgrounds. The key to not missing out on the big ideas is to avoid letting the opportunity to test it out pass you buy. This, as was the case in South America, may result in ethical dilemmas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

      <title>OS Privacy Controls</title>
      <link>https://zararsiddiqi.com/os-privacy-controls/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 05 Mar 2021 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://zararsiddiqi.com/os-privacy-controls/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The challenge with maintaining privacy is that when one provides information to a trusted party, that party unintentionally relays it to other parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, you give your number to a friend who has no intention of relaying it to marketers or any other third party. Yet, when that friend performs a &amp;ldquo;Login with X&amp;rdquo;, they will send your information to X without intending to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at it a level deeper this is the flow of information:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your OS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;App you used to share your info&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your friend&amp;rsquo;s OS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your friend&amp;rsquo;s app where they read your info&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;App your friend used which now has that info&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, the later the security measures are applied in this chain, the less effective they are in protecting you. The security on your friend&amp;rsquo;s OS is there to protect them, not you. The encryption on the network is there to transfer the data securely and doesn&amp;rsquo;t concern itself with where that data will eventually end up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individual applications aren&amp;rsquo;t terribly concerned with your privacy as they&amp;rsquo;re usually optimized to make a profit by competing for your attention. We can try holding them to standards by passing laws like GDPR, but that requires thousands of companies to align and adhere to protocols that are not enforceable via a technical implementation. Privacy needs to be built-in, not complied with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decentralized, encrypted peer-to-peer networks offer solutions around this, but they are heavy on friction and there&amp;rsquo;s no path to mass adoption. The most feasible way to keeping information private is for the OS to take responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have the OS store an indicator whether users are comfortable sharing personal information with third parties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it&amp;rsquo;s a yes, then that&amp;rsquo;s more or less the current state and we are at the mercy of the app&amp;rsquo;s policies and procedures, and rely on them to do the &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it&amp;rsquo;s a no, then anytime a user&amp;rsquo;s information is being requested, the OS can step in and filter it out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if Anne has Bob as a contact and Anne is trying to &amp;ldquo;Login with X&amp;rdquo;, the OS detects that Bob had answered a &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; to the privacy question on his phone, then Bob&amp;rsquo;s information would be filtered out in any information that is shared with X during Ann&amp;rsquo;s interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is certainly a walled garden situation because you&amp;rsquo;re reliant on the OS, but it certainly beats the current state where apps request all kinds of permissions which user&amp;rsquo;s blindly agree to, leaving them exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the two main mobile operating systems, Android and iOS, I have to wonder which of these is more likely to implement such a mechanism. Their business models can provide some clues. Google&amp;rsquo;s business model is built on advertising so it is not in their interest to restrict such information sharing as it&amp;rsquo;s a direct hit to their top line. Apple isn&amp;rsquo;t in the advertising business, they&amp;rsquo;re more in the hardware business and more likely to care about this. Not saying they will, but they&amp;rsquo;re more likely than Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A similar idea was floated by &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26286561&#34;&gt;otterley on Hacker News&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently Apple added a feature to iOS that allows you only to allow selected photos to be accessible by an app. This allows the user to respond positively to an access request, but allow the app to see only a subset (or zero) actual photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be a very useful feature for Apple to do the same for contacts: the app would think it&amp;rsquo;s getting access to your contacts, but would only actually receive a subset of them, and be none the wiser. This would be a tremendous boon for privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would sign up for this.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>On Estimation</title>
      <link>https://zararsiddiqi.com/on-estimation/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 26 Feb 2021 09:00:01 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://zararsiddiqi.com/on-estimation/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is updated with the discussion &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/zararsiddiqi?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAABJAi8BNa5A9nRcW_qPRf8Xk8oK98MhQ9w&amp;amp;lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_detail_base%3BHFX3l9eHQ0ORfnrKV2Qscw%3D%3D&amp;amp;licu=urn%3Ali%3Acontrol%3Ad_flagship3_detail_base-actor_container&amp;amp;lici=gdZcee8ZRsuungEIR8d%2Bfw%3D%3D&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estimation and/or pointing has three purposes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To generate discussion within the team so people have an idea of the complexity of the work and are aligned on what it takes to get the job done, and what the general approach will be. It&amp;rsquo;s the main reason we have story points - to see how aligned people are in their view of the work. It generates discussion and that conversation is by far the most useful feature of story points.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capacity planning - this is usually a Scrum thing.  I have honestly never seen this done right. Ever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forecasting - management just abuses this and we should try to stay away from this because it gives the illusion of accuracy disguised as precision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first is easily the most useful part and the second and third are rarely useful, and often harmful for many reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we do want to do estimating, I recommend reading the Ron Jeffries (the guy who invented story points) who has a nice blog post about the pitfalls of story points and how when he came up with the idea it was mainly about developer focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have tried pulling predictability out of this and I have found that the pre-conditions required to do that are rarely there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How open is the culture in the organization to a communicated date changing? If the prediction is off, does it set off panic mode along with countless explanations of why the date changed? Do we have to do variance analysis which invariably involves some story point math to justify the new date? Do we point fingers at why we were “wrong” in our first predictions? If the culture in the organization is open to change, then sure, make some predictions knowing that there is psychological safety in case the predictions are wrong. That level of trust and culture are hard to create. Don’t get me wrong, at the team-level with the developers, designers and BAs, everything is good. It’s at a higher level where these predictions are taken as stone way more often than not, and any change to them ends up reflecting poorly (and unfairly) on the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other, much more deeper question is, what is the investment in forecasting (and it is quite a significant investment) buying you when it’s going to be mostly a guess anyway? Usually, this is tied to budgeting and resource allocation and there are much better ways of going about that like the Beyond Budgeting Principles and the work of Bjarte Bogsnes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is a need for predictability, it is in my view best achieved by analyzing Cycle Time and Throughput (i.e., how many days does it take from requirement to production, concept to cash). However, even that’s not predictability, those are continuous improvement metrics which you can rejig to get some predictability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in short. I would question the need for predictability, because predictability has a cultural and economic cost which may not always be worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>On Planning in Kanban</title>
      <link>https://zararsiddiqi.com/on-planning-in-kanban/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 26 Feb 2021 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://zararsiddiqi.com/on-planning-in-kanban/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;backlog refinement&amp;rdquo; time is the planning time to see what we should be working on next. This is like sprint planning except there is no idea of commitment and it&amp;rsquo;s just planning what&amp;rsquo;s ahead without dealing with when things should be done because we acknowledge that things will take what they take - we try to be as fast as possible and seek to continuously improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To plan effectively in Kanban one has to make good use of the this time. You can use it to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plan out what the next month might look like at a high-level&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the refined column is running thin, talk about some upcoming stories so there&amp;rsquo;s enough in there that we&amp;rsquo;re maintaining a continuous flow of work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use that time for a technical discussion related to some work that&amp;rsquo;s upcoming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are no rules as to how you might use that time, it&amp;rsquo;s just up to the team to use it effectively. This flexibility can be scary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no problem against Scrum. We&amp;rsquo;re just very poor at meeting commitment and we over-commit to things and complete nothing because we have too many things in progress. Some of that is due to external dependencies, but most of it is trying to jam everything into a sprint. We used to complete less than 50% of our stories when in Scrum and wasted so much time planning for stuff that we didn&amp;rsquo;t even get to, that it was quite wasteful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So a Kanbanish system helps with that by forcing you plan &amp;ldquo;just in time&amp;rdquo; (hence the WIP limit on the refined column). You can do this in Scrum too, but here it&amp;rsquo;s more explicit. Scrum emphasizes commitments, Kanban flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;if-planning-is-the-what-where-do-we-plan-the-how-is-it-when-the-developer-picks-up-the-story&#34; &gt;If planning is the what, where do we plan the how? Is it when the developer picks up the story?
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#if-planning-is-the-what-where-do-we-plan-the-how-is-it-when-the-developer-picks-up-the-story&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It sounds like you&amp;rsquo;re talking about how you might want to break up the work related to the story that appeared in the &amp;ldquo;Refined&amp;rdquo; column because you want to work in small pieces and perhaps split work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just because a story is refined doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean it can&amp;rsquo;t be split. Developers can chat after refinement and split the work further into more stories (or just sub-task it) after refinement. There is no need for a PO to be present in this discussion as they&amp;rsquo;ve already prioritized the &amp;lsquo;what&amp;rsquo; part. Developer can after talk in small groups to split/organize the work accordingly without any input from PO. If we discover something during this splitting and it changes the &amp;lsquo;cost&amp;rsquo; of the feature, then let the PO know of this new information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d even make the phrase &amp;ldquo;the developer picks up the story&amp;rdquo; optional. It happens whenever the developer realizes that the story needs to be broken down. This can happen after they &amp;ldquo;pick it up&amp;rdquo; and move it to &amp;ldquo;in progress&amp;rdquo; OR even if it&amp;rsquo;s in &amp;lsquo;Refined&amp;rsquo;. The moment to do it is when you learn you need to.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Is Scrum suitable for complicated bug fixes?</title>
      <link>https://zararsiddiqi.com/bug-fixes-and-scrum/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 Jan 2021 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://zararsiddiqi.com/bug-fixes-and-scrum/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A podcast listener asked how to use Scrum when the primary responsibility of the team is software maintenance and fixing complicated bugs which are hard to reproduce and take a long time to fix. How do we measure value when all we do is fix bugs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.buzzsprout.com/883858/7300141&#34;&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the podcast&lt;/a&gt; and my response to the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sprints are a good mechanism to get a team that is used to delivering in long cycles (i.e., waterfall) to start thinking about how to deliver in shorter cycles. The timebox forces you to release code and think in small increments. It forces you reflect on what you delivered and how you delivered in much shorter cycles than what people were used to before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are not a one-size-fits-all solution that can be applied to any problem domain. I would take the some of the principles at play in sprints (not just sprints but any similar mechanism) offer and apply it to your problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if your mean time to recovery/repair (MMTR) is on average two weeks, you should focus on continually reducing your MTTR. Whether it be through root cause analysis of the bug that you just fixed, performing refactorings, better documentation etc. That becomes the metric you optimize for, not value delivered or “points” delivered (ugh, never use points as a productivity metric – I can’t believe I put that in writing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sprints appear to be too artificial of a constraint in your context. The main benefit of timeboxing in your example might just be to limit how long you work on a bug before you deem it not worth investing in anymore (kind of like to avoid analysis paralysis).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example of a Scrum/agile principle being applied would be planning/prioritization. As your work seems to be highly variable (i.e., not quite predictable), planning for it is different so concepts like sprint planning don’t apply well. Instead, you could track and visualize the different categories of bugs, their root causes, where they were found in the code, etc. so that you get a sense of where the high-risk areas are in your code are, and then you can dedicate some time to improve these areas in a “planning” session. You can do planning without doing sprint planning!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of a sprint commitment can be translated in your context to limiting work in progress. Sprint commitments are a focusing constraint that limit how many things a team works on and allows the team to focus without getting distracted by anything else. In your case, you can limit how many bugs you work on at the same time to a manageable number, say one. This way your “commitment” is to fix this one bug before you move to the next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very simple but critical agile principle: if you limit how many things you work on at the same time, there’s a significantly higher chance that you’ll do them well. And you’ll get more done. In my view, this is one of the most counterintuitive and fundamental principles of software development which most people struggle with and almost always fail to implement. Mastery of this is rare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for measuring value. technically, you’re not adding business value as the customer isn’t getting any new benefits. Though I can easily argue that you’re making the system more stable and reducing cost by ensuring angry customers don’t call to complain. You&amp;rsquo;re not increasing customer satisfaction, but you&amp;rsquo;re preventing it from taking a dive. I would encourage you to think about the opportunity cost of not fixing the bug, i.e., what would happen if you didn’t fix the bug? Would the system crash be resulting in countless hours of everyone scrambling? Would you lose customers? Would morale suffer? The avoidance of this is the value that you’re adding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may find it difficult to measure these because management rarely pays attention to these things and are more swayed by new features, so we tend to measure those, not the hairy implications of avoiding software maintenance. Management is usually not in tune with the reality of how teams operate and senior management listens to middle management and are often further detached from reality. Ultimately, in most organizations (but not the great ones) they’re the ones who decide (whether they know it or not) what methodology to follow on the ground. So just because a team is using Scrum doesn’t mean it’s right for them. It just may mean it was unwittingly imposed on them. I would encourage you to look at the principles behind Scrum and see if those can be applied, not the methodology verbatim.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Architectural Tension</title>
      <link>https://zararsiddiqi.com/architecture-tension/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 18 Nov 2020 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://zararsiddiqi.com/architecture-tension/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was trying to understand how an app that I intend to contribute to was structured and was scanning through its many Git repositories. The path of least resistance was well worn. Some were forks of other with a few classes changed, others were more or less duplications with deployment parameters modified. In general, the preference to create a new repo to avoid the baggage that any code brings with it was preferred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When thinking about how to organize assets, Robert Martin&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Clean Architecture&lt;/em&gt; is helpful. Specifically, in Chapter 13 titled Component Cohesion, there is a gem of an idea which has always been useful. Some of Martin&amp;rsquo;s ideas seem a little extreme (e.g., strong preference for unary methods), but this one relating to organizing components has more universal appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will paraphrase the three principles in a way that helped me understand them, and then talk about the tension that architects must struggle with when staying true to all three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-the-reuserelease-equivalence-principle-rep&#34; &gt;1. The Reuse/Release Equivalence Principle (REP)
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#1-the-reuserelease-equivalence-principle-rep&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you intend on making something re-usable it must also be independently releasable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is intuitive enough but we can quickly run into situations where this breaks our worldview. Take for example &lt;code&gt;ServiceA&lt;/code&gt; which depends on &lt;code&gt;ServiceB&lt;/code&gt; and is consumed by &lt;code&gt;ClientA&lt;/code&gt;. We can make &lt;code&gt;ServiceA&lt;/code&gt; reusable with the right version management, but if &lt;code&gt;ServiceB&lt;/code&gt; does not adhere to this principle, &lt;code&gt;ClientA&lt;/code&gt; has no visibility into the stability of &lt;code&gt;ServiceA&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If &lt;code&gt;ServiceB&lt;/code&gt; does not maintain versions or is connected to assets (e.g., databases, queues) where the change in their behaviour changes the behaviour of the APIs that &lt;code&gt;ServiceB&lt;/code&gt; exposes, then it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really matter how well you&amp;rsquo;re organizing &lt;code&gt;ServiceA&lt;/code&gt; because that&amp;rsquo;s not where the unpredictability is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To stay true to this principle a significant portion of the stack must follow it, not just the top-most layers. If you&amp;rsquo;re developing greenfield apps this is fairly easy to adhere to. However, if you&amp;rsquo;re neck-deep in legacy systems this becomes challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The larger point remains powerful - we have to put the effort in to make things reusable and that involves more than just writing the feature. The cost of reusability that we often don&amp;rsquo;t pay and are surprised when it&amp;rsquo;s low includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Well-designed APIs that abstract the solution neatly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Documentation of the APIs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communication of change via the proper versioning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communication of change via meaningful release notes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before/after examples of API changes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making things reusable is not just about an up-front cost. Doing all the above is an ongoing investment and falls under the umbrella of releasability. The latter supports the former.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-the-common-closure-principle-ccp&#34; &gt;2. The Common Closure Principle (CCP)
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#2-the-common-closure-principle-ccp&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Group together things that change at the same time for the same reason. If either is not true, keep them apart.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the class level this is probably easy enough to follow: just design smaller classes and have them do one thing (SRP).  Elevating this idea at the component level becomes difficult because components are higher order functions and intentionally encompass more concern. The language in the business domain doesn&amp;rsquo;t neatly fit into our technical architectures, producing greys in our designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microservices architectures &amp;ldquo;simplify&amp;rdquo; this by erring on the side of keeping things apart. Proponents would rather deal with their proliferation rather than worry about bundling things that may change for different reasons into components. After all, what is the cost we pay for just keeping things apart?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An answer could be that since most of the time we&amp;rsquo;re maintaining software, the preference would be for the change to be easier, rather than the component to be reusable. This ties to the first principle which builds the tension within these principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-the-common-reuse-principle-crp&#34; &gt;3. The Common Reuse Principle (CRP)
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#3-the-common-reuse-principle-crp&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t depend on things you don&amp;rsquo;t need.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re writing &lt;code&gt;ServiceA&lt;/code&gt; and it depends on &lt;code&gt;ServiceB&lt;/code&gt; which has &lt;code&gt;bMethod1()&lt;/code&gt; an &lt;code&gt;bMethod2()&lt;/code&gt;, and you&amp;rsquo;re only using &lt;code&gt;bMethod1()&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;ServiceA&lt;/code&gt;, then this principle might suggest that you&amp;rsquo;re better off doing one of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;moving &lt;code&gt;bMethod1()&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;ServiceA&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;creating &lt;code&gt;ServiceC&lt;/code&gt; which holds &lt;code&gt;bMethod1()&lt;/code&gt; and have &lt;code&gt;ServiceA&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ServiceB&lt;/code&gt; depend on it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yikes! Why can&amp;rsquo;t I just not use &lt;code&gt;dbMethod2()&lt;/code&gt; and move on with my life? The argument is that there is an additional cost of compiling, validating and deploying &lt;code&gt;dbMethod2()&lt;/code&gt; which we should minimize. Your mileage may vary with this principle but it&amp;rsquo;s fair to say that this is very context-dependent - what isn&amp;rsquo;t but this more so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the methods above are cloud-based functions (like Lambdas) then this principle applies based simply on cost. If it&amp;rsquo;s just a function in a class then less so. This principle pushes you to think about the costs of depending on things whether they be big or small. Nothing kills speed like dependencies and sometimes we don&amp;rsquo;t even know we&amp;rsquo;re dependent on something until it&amp;rsquo;s too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-tension-diagram&#34; &gt;The Tension Diagram
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-tension-diagram&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://zararsiddiqi.com/images/architecture-component-tension-diagram-uncle-bob.png&#34; alt=&#34;&amp;amp;ldquo;Tension Diagram - Component Cohesion&amp;amp;rdquo;&#34;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The edges of the diagram describe the cost of abandoning the principle on the opposite vertex.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designing good software is difficult because it requires us to have an opinion on how the future will play out. Nobody is good at that so we arm ourselves with tools that help us hedge our decisions in the face of uncertainty and risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tension Diagram is a valuable thinking tool that forces one to ask themselves whether the trade-offs they&amp;rsquo;re making are acceptable. It can be applied at any &amp;ldquo;level&amp;rdquo; of software - from designing an Angular component to a Machine Learning model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few takeaways for me and I&amp;rsquo;ll piggy back on the repository proliferation complaint from earlier to ground this in reality:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we don&amp;rsquo;t split our app into the right amount of repositories, we end up needing too many releases to deploy simple features&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we don&amp;rsquo;t bound the repository&amp;rsquo;s concerns correctly, we reduce the chance of reuse&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If our app depends on a repo that does more than what our app needs it to do, we introduce unpredictability in cost&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can use the converse and inverse of these statements to uncover more.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dissonance of Using Functional Concepts in Non-functional Stacks</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Side-effect free functions (i.e., pure functions) lend themselves to easy unit testing. If the ability to test software is key to creating quality then it stands to reason that the more pure functions a piece of software has, all other things being equal, the higher its quality. Taking this idea a step further we may posit that to achieve high quality we must maximize the amount of pure functions in our codebase. Or at least maximize the amount of code that lives in pure functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not only proponents of functional programming who would agree with this sentiment. Even procedural or object-oriented programmers would welcome large swathes of the codebase being easy to formally verify. No matter which language or school of programming one grew up with, certain universal rules have always applied. For example, we strive to keep our functions and modules small, independent and where possible, re-usable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A similar comment can be made about state. The best way to manage state is to not manage it at all. Functional programming’s concept of referential transparency is its opinion statement on state management. Its implementations involve passing state around as parameters just so we never end up in a situation where we have to think about whether the state is what we expect it to be. Procedural and OOP programmers hate state management too but someone has to do it. So you end up either managing it “locally” or shove it deep into the layers hoping that the deeper the level, the less code we have to write. Both approaches strive to make state management straightforward enough to take guesswork out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benefits of immutability and side-effect free code resonate with most and when working in non-functional environments I have found it beneficial to apply concepts rooted in functional languages. When doing so I’ve often encountered a dissonance when organizing software elements (e.g., classes, packages, modules), and the source of this dissonance has been hard to pin down. I’m starting to land on three hypotheses on what the source might be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;defining-behaviour-in-classes&#34; &gt;Defining Behaviour in Classes
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#defining-behaviour-in-classes&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Object Oriented Programming (Java being its standard bearer) has often urged me to model things as objects and assign behaviour to those objects. A &lt;code&gt;Dog&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;barks()&lt;/code&gt;. A &lt;code&gt;WashingMachine&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;washes()&lt;/code&gt;, an &lt;code&gt;Email&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;sends()&lt;/code&gt; itself. Wait, what? No, an email can’t send itself. An email needs to have an &lt;code&gt;EmailSender&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;send()&lt;/code&gt; an &lt;code&gt;Email&lt;/code&gt; because we also have to worry about MIME types and formats and headers and on and on. So maybe we need an &lt;code&gt;EmailRenderer&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;generate()&lt;/code&gt; an &lt;code&gt;Email&lt;/code&gt; and pass it to &lt;code&gt;EmailSender&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;send()&lt;/code&gt; it, and maybe we check the &lt;code&gt;EmailResponse&lt;/code&gt; sent by the &lt;code&gt;SmtpServer&lt;/code&gt; to figure out whether it got &lt;code&gt;sent?()&lt;/code&gt;. This would of course rely on the &lt;code&gt;SmtpConfig&lt;/code&gt; and a host of other folk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behaviours often tend to have side effects and when they’re encouraged to live near the data they’re modelling, we quickly run into a three-way tension:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;modelling the data for the entity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keeping behaviours of the entity close to the data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;writing side-effect free code which implements the behaviour.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A class is too simple of a container to house these three animals peacefully. It is here where the proliferation of classes happens. To model something relatively simple we write classes that do these things separately. This is good because SRP but it does come at the expense of the real world thing you’re representing being split apart in terms that are incongruent with the real world. The real world is essentially too complex to satisfy both SRP and objects which represent the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, an EmailRenderer isn’t a real world thing. Domain Driven Design (the blue book) deals with this by creating different classification for objects (e.g, Aggregators, Value Objects) which seem like legal explanations on why we can (and should) use classes and objects to represent things even though there’s not a natural fit there. And when we can’t really fit anything anywhere we can always rely on something like the MethodObject pattern which always gives us an out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter how many design patterns from Gang of Four or DDD we apply, we are merely organizing our code within the constraints of classes. It doesn’t always feel like a natural fit because my brain is wired to see classes and their instance objects represent the real world where the software is being used, not the things that glue the software together (which is what we end up doing when organizing those three things - models, data and behaviour).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of writing side-effect free functions I end up writing side-effect free classes while trying to shove the behaviour out of the classes, which is antithetic to what many consider OOP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;diminishing-returns-as-layers-increase&#34; &gt;Diminishing Returns as Layers Increase
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#diminishing-returns-as-layers-increase&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unfulfilled promise of Object Models was to think in terms of real world objects and then have data persistence abstracted by an ORM. That never quite happened. The idea that there’s only one place where the relationships between your data can be represented and that place is not the data store was never a great marketing pitch but we went along with it. In those days there were usually two representations of these relationships: the database and the Object Model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acceleration in frameworks has unfortunately resulted in specialization (probably another topic) and now we have the same data represented in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The database&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The object model&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;REST API (usually a subset of the object model)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the UIs object model&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the UI’s state management code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is a lot of representations! I am not lamenting the need to manage state. We have to manage the state of the UI somewhere (e.g., what dropdown element is selected). It’s that in addition to managing that we also have to worry about managing what we just retrieved from the server. WebSockets in combination with streaming APIs do a good job of lessening this concern, but they don’t take it away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most instances we’re still making simple REST calls to “get data for the UI”. In such instances writing side-effect free functions in UI code is good, but it feels like we’re wasting the tools at our disposal. The risk often lies closer to where the core business logic lives or where the state gets manipulated. If those areas are off-limits or live in older stacks, improving the quality of a piece of the stack that has low risk to begin with could be argued to be waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can test the daylights out of my NgRx stack and apply all kinds of cool functional programming concepts but am I really reducing the risk? After all the higher up the stack you go the less the risk (usually), and the real issues usually lie closer to the system of record. Wouldn’t it be just as effective to write a for loop instead of a recursive method?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lack-of-constraints&#34; &gt;Lack of Constraints
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#lack-of-constraints&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the language allows for mutability there’s nothing but discipline left to prevent state mutation. We can follow all the rules of functional programming but the mindset when writing the exact same feature in Elixir and Java will be different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the latter everything is permitted and the environment will not prevent you from unintentionally changing state. Yes, better testing would catch this but now we’re talking about testing whether pointers are pointing to the right thing instead of focusing on delivering business value. &lt;code&gt;List.of()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Map.of()&lt;/code&gt; are valuable APIs which help kickstart a person’s functional programming in a non-functional language journey. However, they’re only pieces of the puzzle that put the onus on the programmer to not make mistakes you wouldn’t have to worry about making if you were using a functional language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all three cases above I’ve tried to describe some of the workarounds that get me closer to writing functional code. My philosophy has been to take an incremental approach to improvement. It doesn’t matter if the rest of the app is following a different paradigm. Writing side-effect free functions and passing state along rather than centrally managing it is a welcome improvement and someone somewhere at some point in time will be glad that I did. I hope.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Definition of News Has Been Legally Changed</title>
      <link>https://zararsiddiqi.com/definition-of-news-legally-changed/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 Sep 2020 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://zararsiddiqi.com/definition-of-news-legally-changed/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A tipping point has been reached in what is legally considered news. Critiquing a news source by  questioning the facts presented, the manner in which they were communicated, the source&amp;rsquo;s validity, the broadcaster&amp;rsquo;s motivations or any inherent biases that may exist, is no longer a fruitful activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That line of critique has been swept aside by legally muddying what news is. The presenter is no longer required to convey any truths and the onus of verification has entirely shifted from the news source to the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two ways on how this has been achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Burden of Verification&lt;/em&gt;: A &amp;ldquo;reasonable&amp;rdquo; viewer is expected to &amp;ldquo;arrive with an appropriate amount of skepticism&amp;rdquo; based on the material presented by the news outlet. Any lies that the news broadcast may convey are not actionable because the viewer is expected to filter out lies from the truth. Even if the news source is spewing lies they&amp;rsquo;re given a pass because the viewer should have known better to believe it in the first place to believe it. That is, any &amp;ldquo;reasonable&amp;rdquo; viewer. Adding this word into any court&amp;rsquo;s ruling opens up the door to say anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;False Presupposition&lt;/em&gt;: The presenter can state an assumption which is very likely to be false (or known to be false) and then base future arguments on the suspect assumption. As long as what follows traces back to the false assumption, all is good and anything can be said. For example if a host says &amp;ldquo;We’re going to start by stipulating that everything Michael Cohen has told the feds is absolutely true&amp;rdquo;, then the presenter has wide latitude on what conclusions they can draw, without ever worrying about whether Cohen was lying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two compounding factors which make this especially harmful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inability for Skepticism&lt;/em&gt;:  The constant bombarding of rhetoric in news shows overwhelms its audience and amplifies the echo in the chamber that the viewer already lives in. There is no pause (or desire to pause) to reflect on whether the information presented should be met with skepticism. The expectation that the consumer has the ability to be skeptical is wrong. The medium has become powerful enough that it overrides a human being&amp;rsquo;s ability to be skeptical, especially one who &lt;em&gt;wants to believe&lt;/em&gt; in the lie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Repackaging&lt;/em&gt;: Having talk shows disguise as news programs is a laughably easy way of repackaging lies without risking the penalty of being called out. Twenty-four hour news channels can have talk shows with millions of viewers who tune in to get some semblance of valid information. I provide the &amp;ldquo;some semblance&amp;rdquo; qualifier only because the audience have been conditioned enough and are polarized enough that they no longer can think on their own, and only tune in to reinforce whatever they already believe. As there is no material differentiation between talk shows and news programs for the audience, the convenient repackaging gives the broadcaster an out to say anything and hide behind the argument, &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s not news, it&amp;rsquo;s a talk show&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TDSB Survey Results Can Be Misleading</title>
      <link>https://zararsiddiqi.com/tdsb-survey/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 23 Aug 2020 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://zararsiddiqi.com/tdsb-survey/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you plan on making data-driven decisions and that data is being collected via faulty techniques, you&amp;rsquo;re going to have a bad time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week the Toronto District School Board announced that it was re-planning how students would return to school after survey results showed that more parents than expected were planning to send their kids back to school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether classes are at 50%, 75% or 100% capacity makes a big difference in how you might plan this. In this case, only about 15-30% of parents said they were planning to use online education, with the rest preferring coming back to school. Given this data the TDSB is delaying the start of the school year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is the survey used which asked two questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Would you be comfortable with online learning?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will you be sending kids back to school in September?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the issue: this is loss aversion theory at its finest. Parents who have little intention of sending their kids to school will answer &amp;lsquo;yes&amp;rsquo; to the second question because they want to leave their options open. They may have done so only to avoid the loss of the option of sending their kid to school, without actually having any intention of doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the dynamic situation around Covid where people are monitoring daily cases and weekly averages, day-to-day decision-making is based on recent and relevant data because the value of data decays very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flaw with TDSBs approach is that it failed to give weight to the importance of recency. Parents will not accurately state their intentions for a future time period without knowing the Covid trends preceding that period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what to do if you&amp;rsquo;re TDSB and want to have an idea of how many students might show up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to look at proxy metrics and not ask the direct question. The question that they can ask is this: if school started tomorrow, would you send your kids back to school?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a better question because as a surveyor you are gauging current attitudes based on current information. It is more accurate to extrapolate this answer and Covid statistics, and apply them to a future date, than asking people what they would do given a future, hypothetical situation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Short Analysis of an Analysis: YouTube Trending Videos</title>
      <link>https://zararsiddiqi.com/youtube-trending-videos-critique/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 11 Jul 2020 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://zararsiddiqi.com/youtube-trending-videos-critique/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;People have been trying to peek underneath &amp;ldquo;black box&amp;rdquo; algorithms for decades. The most popular one is the quest to crack how Google&amp;rsquo;s search ranking algorithm works so your article/product is as high as possible. With no knowledge of how the internals of these algorithms work we are forced to observe the &lt;em&gt;output&lt;/em&gt; of the algorithm based on the &lt;em&gt;inputs&lt;/em&gt; in hopes of observing trends and tendencies. Though sometimes companies provide guidance on how content is prioritized their precise workings have been a mystery. For example, Google stating that faster pages will receive higher rankings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brute force strategies like content farms to more specific ones like keyword tailing are used to find an edge and &amp;ldquo;trick&amp;rdquo; the algorithm.  Taking an economic view this can be viewed as a &amp;ldquo;free market&amp;rdquo; enterprise where agents (content publishers) are trying to find a competitive edge in the market (ranking) with novel strategies eventually being priced into the algorithm. It is a game of cat-and-mouse where the market is really a company instead of public enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This game makes for some very fun statistical analysis (aided by machine learning toolkits) to decipher just how to structure your content so it is prioritized higher. The latest such endeavor is how to title your videos so they have a higher chance of appearing on YouTube&amp;rsquo;s trending videos. Some findings from 2019 data as summarized by Hustle based on Ammar Al-Yousfi&amp;rsquo;s very enjoyable analysis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Include the current year and the words &amp;ldquo;video,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;vs,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;game,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;new,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;highlights,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;first&amp;rdquo; in your title.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Title length should hit between 36 and 64 characters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use tags in your video. Almost all trending videos have tags.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show a person in the video thumbnail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On first reading one can surmise this as guidance on how to structure videos to have them appear on trending lists. But the question here is whether trending videos happen to have more tags or do more tags cause the video to be trending? This is not answerable until we actually examine the number of videos that are not trending through random sampling which the analysis does not do. This is a significant shortcoming of any such analysis. Therefore, findings like the above if treated as guidance can mislead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examining the correlation matrix we can see some self-fulfilling prophecies such as more views, likes and comments being highly correlated with being on the trending list. These can be safely ignored because it is extremely probable that these are high because these videos are already on the trending list, not what caused them to be there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://zararsiddiqi.com/images/youtube-trending-videos-correlation-matrix.png&#34; alt=&#34;&amp;amp;ldquo;YouTube Trending Videos Correlation Matrix, ammar-alyousfi.com&amp;amp;rdquo;&#34;&gt;
YouTube Trending Videos Correlation Matrix, ammar-alyousfi.com&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the real question here is should we treat this as guidance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to cop-out and say &amp;ldquo;it likely doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter but it most likely can&amp;rsquo;t hurt&amp;rdquo;. I want to explain this (to myself more than to the reader).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter because &lt;code&gt;engagement/time period&lt;/code&gt; is likely the primary indicator of why something might be considered trending. It is far more valuable to spend our effort trying to either increase the numerator or decrease the denominator. If the latter doesn&amp;rsquo;t sound intuitive I&amp;rsquo;m thinking publishing a video when the topic is hot (e.g., post the highlight pack right after the game ended).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the findings, the only one that is relevant to our equation is the picture in the thumbnail as that can be a strong visual that works at a psychological level to trigger behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say that it likely can&amp;rsquo;t hurt because there is a chance that this can hurt. Companies will sniff out and penalize gaming of algorithms (like content farms) though in this case the suggestions are so vanilla that they may get classified as unremarkable in any algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mining for Side-Effects in Complex Adaptive Systems</title>
      <link>https://zararsiddiqi.com/complex-adaptive-systems-exaptation/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 06 Jul 2020 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://zararsiddiqi.com/complex-adaptive-systems-exaptation/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A complex adaptive system (CAS) is a system in which a perfect understanding of the individual parts does not automatically convey a perfect understanding of the whole system&amp;rsquo;s behaviour. Most systems where humans play central roles are CAS including teams and organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In such a system we cannot confidently make statements such as &lt;em&gt;If we do A, then B will happen&lt;/em&gt;. We can only hypothesize about how doing A will impact the evolution of the larger system. This is because actions have unintended side-effects that go unmonitored. B may very well happen if we do A but it will not be the only thing that happens. C will happen as well. C can reduce the efficacy of B, amplify it, or create other unforeseen effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are wired with strong confirmation bias and unless we acknowledge the wider impact of our actions we will only see B happen because B is what we&amp;rsquo;re looking for (e.g., the Gorilla experiment, radiologist experiment). Those experiments are universal in their nature and underplaying their findings by suggesting that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t apply to our context is ignorance bordering on neglect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awareness of this phenomenon is key in any change initiative as it is not intuitive. We are led to believe that if we follow certain practices and make decisions rooted in agreed upon management principles then we are able to control outcomes. This thinking is wide of the mark for two reasons: it does not take into explicit account the unintended implications of our actions, and it is amplified by our confirmation bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of exaptation is related. Exaptation is a term used in evolutionary biology to describe a trait that has been co-opted for a use other than the one for which natural selection has built it. If we introduce a change A to effect B, we may see A being used as a tool to facilitate C even though it was not intended for it. This is an idea that can generate innovation provided a culture of experimentation and freedom. Contrast this with adaptation where B is specifically planned to fill an evolutionary need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is extremely common to see this phenomenon in software development. Five such examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Team metrics used as performance indicators by management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remote work policies increasing working hours&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Timeboxes (e.g., sprints) used to create project planning milestones&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JIRA used as a personal kanban&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reducing a QA person increasing quality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combining the three ideas we can acknowledge that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;confirmation bias heavily affects our analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there will be side-effects to our actions that will go unnoticed (because of our confirmation bias)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;our actions will result in exaptation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we can conclude that we need to dedicate just as much time monitoring the emergence of intended results than unintended ones. Going further, it is in the unintended results that we are far more likely to see innovative practices emerge. Innovation is not a linear process and often jumps out of nowhere because it is born through exaptation, i.e., repurposing an idea for something that was not its original intent. There are plenty of evolutionary biology and software examples of this phenomenon: dinosaurs flying, human&amp;rsquo;s developing grammar, Microsoft dominating the PC market, cookies resulting in ad tracking, Gmail accounts being used to login to non-Google websites&amp;hellip;the list is endless.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Serverless Architectures and Storing First</title>
      <link>https://zararsiddiqi.com/serverless-architecture-store-first/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 03 Jul 2020 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://zararsiddiqi.com/serverless-architecture-store-first/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If software development is about trade-offs then one of the ones made by an asynchronous serverless architecture is that between architectural complexity and user experience. The user wait time when invoking heavy operations is reduced and architectural complexity is increased. Instead of a synchronous call where request/response across all layers are queued up and waited for, we store the information on disk and process it later. The user interface polls the system to return processed results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can also be debated that architectural complexity is increased because we have split our processing in smaller &amp;ldquo;lambda&amp;rdquo; functions instead of a monolith which contains all the compute logic. On the other hand monoliths can make version control easier as dependencies are reduced. Either way you look at it this can be distilled down to whether we write first and process later, or process while keeping the user waiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All other things being equal, thinking about a single user operation (translate text) as streams that require multiple types of processing (translate to a culture, convert to audio, store) gives the code a higher chance of following the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), which makes it simpler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether to use a serverless architecture can also be influenced by the diversity of the application, notably how many services it relies on to produce results the user expects. As a rule of thumb the more diverse the landscape is the more complex it is. As this complexity increases the probability of failures also increase. How to gracefully handle those failures while keeping compute logic of each service separate is something that comes more naturally to serverless architectures than traditional client-server synchronous models.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Autonomy, Maturity and Chaos</title>
      <link>https://zararsiddiqi.com/autonomy-and-rules/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 02 Jul 2020 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://zararsiddiqi.com/autonomy-and-rules/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We rely on evidence, experience, advice and intuition to make decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there is hard enough data that indicates a path we use it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If not we rely on our previous experience in the matter (or related matter) to guide us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When that is not possible we ask for advice from people who may have that experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And when we don&amp;rsquo;t we use our intuition, which is aided by data, our experience, knowledge gained through consultation, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a team that lacks data, experience and access to information, it will primarily rely on intuition to make day-to-day architectural and implementation decisions. Autonomy in this case can be chaotic because the team doesn&amp;rsquo;t know what they don&amp;rsquo;t know. They don&amp;rsquo;t know any better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value of autonomous teams is well-documented but those benefits can only be achieved if the autonomy that fuels the diversity of their activities is accompanied by the maturity of the people in the team. Without this maturity there is likely to be chaos. Though outside coaching and support can help with the maturity gap it is not a substitute for having strong people on the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autonomy without maturity is chaos. That is not necessarily a bad thing if you can afford to have chaos for an &lt;em&gt;extended&lt;/em&gt; period of time (perhaps because of a high potential payback).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Compliance Metrics</title>
      <link>https://zararsiddiqi.com/compliance-metrics/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2020 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://zararsiddiqi.com/compliance-metrics/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;People will try their best to follow a framework, especially if it is prescribed by someone who is seen as an expert. Though the framework can itself be useful, religious compliance to the framework&amp;rsquo;s metrics can distract from the goals that the framework is supposed to help with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Velocity, throughput, cycle time and any other metric should be subject to this scrutiny. If the goal is to continuously deliver value to your customers then the evaluation of value must happen outside the framework&amp;rsquo;s scope. The framework&amp;rsquo;s metrics are at best a weak proxy to the value delivered. We may be following a particular process very well but the process may not generate the required outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a fundamental issue in adopting any framework whether it be on the manufacturing floor, software delivery, or professional services. In software delivery, throughput can be a dangerous metric to evaluate value delivered because it measures whether something was delivered, not whether people are using the feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GAAP provides a framework of guidelines on how to report financial results. How well we are able to reflect reality within GAAP&amp;rsquo;s constructs is what is seen to be the financial state of a company. The nicety of GAAP is that it is considered &amp;ldquo;generally acceptable&amp;rdquo; and those who evaluate the results (e.g., auditors, analysts) share a common understanding of the nuances of reporting. This is in sharp contrast to software delivery metrics where there is high variability in how people understand the metrics and even higher variability in how they perceive the metrics can be moved in the &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GAAP is an excellent example of how a framework has created shared understanding and practices while allowing for leeway in reporting and interpretation. To me, there is no equivalent in the software industry.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dissorienting Dilemma</title>
      <link>https://zararsiddiqi.com/disorienting-dilemma/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 29 Jun 2020 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://zararsiddiqi.com/disorienting-dilemma/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The dissorienting dilemma is caused when you have an experience that fundamentally does not align with your view of the world and forces you to reconsider what you had assumed tacitly to be true. It is the shifting of a core assumption or belief that forces you to alter your perception because without doing so the world does not make sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disorienting dilemmas do not pose a choice for you where you can turn a blind eye to this new information and continue on your path. They leave you no choice but to construct a new worldview and alter any assumptions that were dependent on your busted up belief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if you always believed an institution to be an exemplary standard bearer of fairness and virtue, and you then witness it committing an act that is the opposite, it may put into question other beliefs and views that were founded on that belief. Or perhaps you were a religious person and found out something so orthogonal to your beliefs contained in the texts that it forced you to question your membership in the religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not possible for personal growth to happen without going through this disorientation multiple times. They can be a source of learning like no other.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Women&#39;s Rights in Islam</title>
      <link>https://zararsiddiqi.com/womens-rights-in-islam/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 29 Jun 2020 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://zararsiddiqi.com/womens-rights-in-islam/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The treatment of women in Islam as characterized by the &amp;ldquo;West&amp;rdquo; has been a source of great sadness for me. It is an unfortunate consequence of a multitude of factors including the lack of differentiation between cultural practices of a region and Islamic beliefs. This misunderstanding is amplified by media and political structures which value simple explanations to complex phenomenon by leveraging ingrained biases. Women have been mistreated and viewed as second-class citizens throughout history. Voting rights, employment opportunities, freedom of movement and genital mutilation are only some of the categories where women have suffered. They have been a step removed from slavery for a large part of our history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a sharp contrast between how Islam views women and what the West&amp;rsquo;s perceptions are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam&amp;rsquo;s Golden Age is largely considered to be between the 8th century and 14th century when scientific advancements and economic developments were abundant. The start of this period is approximately 150 years after the Prophet&amp;rsquo;s death, and it is important to note the foundations that were laid during and shortly after the Prophet&amp;rsquo;s time that elevated the role of women in society. The saddest aspect of modern Islam is the failure of its political and religious leaders to look back at this era and examine the principles and attitudes that that era was founded on. That is entirely another story, but suffice to say that modern Islam &amp;ldquo;leaders&amp;rdquo; are heavily influenced by patriarchal customs and beliefs of a region, not a religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Quran is explicit about women and men having equal rights in Islam (9:71, 4:124). This is a concept that only started to come to light in the United States in 1920 when the 19th amendment was passed and women were given the right to vote. The US Supreme Court denied women suffrage rights in 1875 (Minor v Happersett). Divorce existed prior to Islam but Islam made it more favorable to women in terms of seeking one (instant), property rights and support after divorce. Unlike the Catholic concept of indissolubility of marriage Islam only encouraged couples to seek recourse, not make it illegal to divorce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Quran makes no comment on abortion either way. However, Islam offers a wide latitude on women pursuing abortions. Most scholars agree that within the first 120 days there is no debate. After that, abortions are legal in case of incest, rape, threat to the woman&amp;rsquo;s life, fetal deformity and even social or economical reasons. Though the details vary, the larger idea of providing women access and rights to abortion is significantly ahead of its time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always been fortunate to have worked with people who had more experience and knowledge than me. Some of these mentors include &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/dennis-grant-9a49175/&#34;&gt;Dennis Grant&lt;/a&gt; who showed me what Object Oriented Programming truly meant, &lt;a href=&#34;https://sessionize.com/haroon-rafique/&#34;&gt;Haroon Rafique&lt;/a&gt; who taught me how to be a professional programmer, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/rob-lokinger-5b9253/&#34;&gt;Rob Lokinger&lt;/a&gt; who taught me about people and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/marksamson/&#34;&gt;Mark Samson&lt;/a&gt; who coached me on delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently I&amp;rsquo;m colleagues with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/cbereczki/&#34;&gt;Csaba Bereczki&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/ginomarckx/&#34;&gt;Gino Marckx&lt;/a&gt; (who I worked with at EPAM as well) and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffmorgan5/&#34;&gt;Jeff Morgan&lt;/a&gt;, some of the best coaches in the industry. All of us share a passion for Continuous Delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make the most of this opportunity and make some memories we started a podcast a few weeks back. It is short, packed with content, and unrehearsed. We aim to keep it between 15-20 minutes.  You can listen to the episodes &lt;a href=&#34;https://continuousdeliverypodcast.buzzsprout.com/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; or you can download the podcast from wherever you get your podcasts.

      <description>&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://zararsiddiqi.com/images/tokyo-japan-subway-crowd.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Wait, there&#39;s more.&#34;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;How&amp;rsquo;s it going?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Busy busy busy&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How busy one is has become a symbol of worth and even pride. The thought goes like this: if you&amp;rsquo;re not busy then you&amp;rsquo;re not utilized. If you&amp;rsquo;re not utilized then you&amp;rsquo;re wasting your time. If you&amp;rsquo;re wasting your time then the money you&amp;rsquo;re making is also being wasted. If money is being wasted then why not spend this money somewhere else? So maybe we only need half of you so you&amp;rsquo;re 100% utilized therefore more efficient. And of course we all want to be efficient? How can you possibly argue against being less efficient because that would imply you&amp;rsquo;re less productive?  Thus you have to be busy. Busy busy busy. You must be utilized because we have conflated utilization with efficiency and worse, productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a single phrase that if I hear a team utter I know they&amp;rsquo;re on the wrong path: &lt;em&gt;does everyone have enough work to do?&lt;/em&gt; It is the ultimate sign that the team has little idea how important &lt;a href=&#34;https://zararsiddiqi.com/2019-07-25-professionalism-of-embedding-quality-through-slack/&#34;&gt;slack&lt;/a&gt; is and are focused on utilization as a proxy for productivity when there is ample mathematical and sociological evidence that this is simply not the case. But because it &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; good to be doing &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; we will fill up people&amp;rsquo;s plates to the edges so that we haven&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;wasted&amp;rdquo; anything. What good managers we are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exhibit A in the war against 100% utilization is the principle of queuing capacity utilization. To appreciate this we first have to accept a few things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software development involves heterogeneous activities - unlike a manufacturing plan producing t-shirts or ball bearings, the output being produced is different on a case-to-case basis, no matter how similar it might feel to the end user. For example, a password reset feature on Amazon and Apple may look the same, but behind the scenes the implementation details are very different (e.g., systems, languages, architecture, organization structures)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software development work has high variability - two random activities or features will take different lengths of time to complete. For example, a password reset feature and a single sign-on implementation will take different lengths of time based on sheer complexity of the problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software development is knowledge work - it requires large amounts of collaboration with other people and deep thought regarding problem solving.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every organization has a system of how work is done. At the highest level work is identified, prioritized, and then queued for processing by an individual or team.  If all work came into this system at the same rate and was completed at the same rate then you would be foolish not to have 100% utilization as you would have achieved perfect flow. Think of this like a tap being left on in a sink and the water never accumulating above the drain because the rate of water coming in is in perfect proportion to the diameter of the holes in the sink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in software development, water doesn&amp;rsquo;t flow at the same rate. Big and small items are put into the queue (i.e., heterogenous) which exit the system at different rates (i.e., high variability). In addition, most pieces of work are not executed by a inherently predictable and scalable resource but by teams who have to work together and are often dependent on each other. Skill gaps, new technologies and that meeting you randomly booked to announce nothing special all take a toll on the team. If the team encounters any impediments (which they absolutely will because of the nature of the work) the queue size (i.e., our backlog) gets bigger and bigger because processing capability is being taxed. The effect of this is much like a traffic jam at rush hour where the highway is 100% utilized but cars exit at a very slow rate. More on that particular topic &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221707003116&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how does pulling less work into the system help since that would mean we have &amp;ldquo;idle&amp;rdquo; teams or people? The simple answer is that &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; people are needed they should be able to help immediately and move the work to the next step in whatever the team is trying to do. If these people happen to always be busy with because we have utilized them at 100%, then they won&amp;rsquo;t be available to service those tasks that depend on them. A very common example is a senior developer who has tasks assigned to her but is also reviewing other people&amp;rsquo;s code.  If we want her to move other people&amp;rsquo;s code quickly to the next step we need her to be highly available. If we clog that availability by assigning her work, we are consciously introducing a delay. But for her to be available to service other people immediately means we can&amp;rsquo;t overload her which means she&amp;rsquo;ll be idle, i.e., her utilization will be less than 100%. We need to optimize for how work moves through the entire system and not focus on local optimization of individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A counterargument to the above is why couldn&amp;rsquo;t she keep busy on other work and only work on code reviews when someone requests one.  That argument does not consider the extremely high cost of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.apa.org/research/action/multitask&#34;&gt;context-switching&lt;/a&gt;, another bane for anyone trying to do any work while also being a source of shame since if you protest about it you&amp;rsquo;ll be labelled someone who can&amp;rsquo;t multitask. And we love people who can multitask!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effect of emergency work (uh oh, we forgot about this regulatory filing) on a fully utilized system will wreak havoc. If there is no available capacity to perform this work we&amp;rsquo;ll have to context-switch multiple people and artifacts (e.g., source code, environments, project management systems, timesheets, production approvals) to accomodate this work. The cost of this switch is rarely measured in any system but instead we will zoom in on available capacity only because it is easy to measure and fairly visible.   We have evolved to value being &lt;code&gt;BusyBusyBusy&lt;/code&gt; when in reality eliminating capacity out of our systems leave us unresponsive to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this in mathematical terms can be boiled down to two well-established statements which I have modified to suit the context of this post:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time to Complete Work = Queue Size / Work Completed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;As utilization increases, queue sizes increase&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first statement is &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little%27s_law&#34;&gt;Little&amp;rsquo;s Law&lt;/a&gt; and the second is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://books.google.ca/books?id=PMMUbHvr-7sC&amp;amp;pg=PA341&amp;amp;lpg=PA341&amp;amp;dq=allen-cunneen%20queue&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=APBy1yQEHT&amp;amp;sig=ACfU3U33crWLWSO52VhsArHxtZRjM77lLQ&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwjwtt258-vnAhV1lXIEHapkDmUQ6AEwB3oECAoQAQ#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=allen-cunneen%20queue&amp;amp;f=false&#34;&gt;Allen-Cuneen Approximation of Queue Length&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, it is imperative that we keep queue sizes low if we want to complete work fast, and the way to keep queue sizes low is to reduce utilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the above has been a poor man&amp;rsquo;s explanation of Donald Reinertsen&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.ca/Principles-Product-Development-Flow-Generation/dp/1935401009&#34;&gt;work&lt;/a&gt; which anyone who is managing people or processes must read. An extremely condensed summary of it appears in an &lt;a href=&#34;https://hbr.org/2012/05/six-myths-of-product-development&#34;&gt;HBR article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another critical aspect to note is that the time works take to complete is a &lt;em&gt;lagging&lt;/em&gt; indicator of the rate at which work gets done because we can&amp;rsquo;t measure that until the work is done. The size of queues is a &lt;em&gt;leading&lt;/em&gt; indicator meaning we can optimize for the work before it starts. The main way we can do this is to make sure there is slack in our system to handle unexpected, heterogenous, highly variable, and cognitive-skill requiring collaborative activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If for some reason there is available capacity in a team or individual which could be used towards improving the flow of work, another time honoured phenomenon held sacred by managers rears its ominous head. It is of course the notion of a fungible resource. The idea that a person&amp;rsquo;s cognitive abilities can be split into separate activities while retaining totality in efficiency, i.e., &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m 30% allocated to this project, 40% to that one and 30% to that one over there that will for sure be cancelled&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We briefly talked about context-switching which is similar to fungibility but there is a very important nuance. Whereas context-switching is often a &lt;em&gt;spontaneous&lt;/em&gt; decision made by a person because of the activities needing to be performed by their team to produce an outcome, the fungible resource is a &lt;em&gt;conscious&lt;/em&gt; decision made by managers to allocate people across different concerns. &amp;ldquo;We probably only need about half of Barry&amp;rsquo;s time on this project but let&amp;rsquo;s not assign him any more work so we make sure he gets his work done on time&amp;rdquo;, said no manager ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impact of high utilization goes well beyond the realms of efficiency and productivity. Perhaps its greatest impact can be seen when viewed on a longer time horizon in the context of continuous improvement. Knowledge work requires knowledge and knowledge changes as technology changes. To benefit from technological improvements one must not only be aware of them, but also be able to understand how they can benefit you in your particular environment. It is one thing to read an article about a new method and another to reflect deeply and test whether and how it is applicable to you. When we are 100% utilized we barely even do the reading let alone the testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freeing up people&amp;rsquo;s time in an open-ended manner so that they can experiment and try out new things sounds like too fluffy of a management objective. We like SMART goals and neat 4-Box models where inputs and outputs are defined. There is no room for giving someone back two hours in their day so they can freeplay and just think about how they could improve their work. Yet it is this time where innovation and improvements come from, but because we can&amp;rsquo;t define clear outputs and outcomes when describing this work, it is instead filled with busy work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gse.harvard.edu/news/uk/18/06/summertime-playtime&#34;&gt;Free play among children&lt;/a&gt; has been seen as an important part of social and cognitive development for decades. This has been extended to adults as well with &lt;a href=&#34;https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-90-481-9667-8_8&#34;&gt;autonomy&lt;/a&gt; acknowledged as an ingredient of productivity, engagement and health. To genuinely action these concepts and give people the autonomy to improve themselves requires us to step back and give back time to people which is not possible if we focus on utilization as a proxy metric for efficiency.  This argument falls further apart when we add a temporal axis to it and view the &amp;ldquo;ROI&amp;rdquo; of an employee in terms of what they produce over a longer period of time. When we hire people we hire them for their present skill. The knowledge in knowledge-work is a moving target and if we don&amp;rsquo;t give people the slack to update their knowledge the returns on that employee will decline with time. Sure, you can argue that you can swap out workers and bring more efficient ones in and skip the development aspect of it, but you&amp;rsquo;d be losing knowledge in this process. It&amp;rsquo;s also a pretty crappy HR strategy for a multitude of reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in learning more about the pitfalls of utilization and the importance of slack, there are few better reads out there than &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.ca/Slack-Getting-Burnout-Busywork-Efficiency/dp/0767907698&#34;&gt;Tom Demarco&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I struggle with &lt;code&gt;BusyBusyBusy&lt;/code&gt; just like anyone else. I also try to acknowledge when I&amp;rsquo;m in that mode which is the first step in escaping it. This topic is closely related to prioritization because if we effectively prioritize and unschedule the stuff we end up scheduling it will automatically create the capacity we seek (assuming we don&amp;rsquo;t replace that freed up time with more busy work). Some questions I ask myself related to prioritization are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I only had to work two hours on one thing and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t allowed to work on anything but that one thing, what would it be?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the one thing I need to learn today so that I can be more effective for the next two weeks?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What made me anxious today and why?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is something that is bugging me that I haven&amp;rsquo;t vocalized with anyone?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the bad news that I am scared of giving someone and what am I doing about it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is an activity that has become so routine for me that I don&amp;rsquo;t even question its value?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are some of the questions that help me prioritize and unschedule work. For me, it&amp;rsquo;s a start.&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2020 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://zararsiddiqi.com/2020-02-22-fakedone/</guid>
      <description>&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://zararsiddiqi.com/images/vince-carter.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Vince Carter - It&#39;s Over!&#34;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accomplishments feel good. Ticking something off a to-do list and seeing it &lt;del&gt;struck out&lt;/del&gt; is a feeling of progress. In the huge heap of things that need to be done, seeing one of them disappear may just provide the momentum to tackle the next one. At times you encounter a situation where you badly want to tick something off that list and you&amp;rsquo;ve completed maybe 80% of it, or even less. Yet that doesn&amp;rsquo;t prevent you from checking it off for whatever reason - maybe the next item is more exciting, maybe the remaining 20% is someone else&amp;rsquo;s job. All you need is that thing to get out of your way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That behaviour has slowly crept into our team Kanban boards. We all have some sort of a &amp;ldquo;Definition of Done&amp;rdquo; which is too often created less as a shared understanding of completion, but more a boundary where another person/group/entity takes over to complete the remaining work. These DoDs stop far short of what &amp;ldquo;done&amp;rdquo; truly means, which is production. And even then you&amp;rsquo;re in the stage of the story where you&amp;rsquo;re getting customer feedback and aren&amp;rsquo;t quite done until you get that, and even then you might iterate on that feedback to do more. But for the sake of finite state machines, let&amp;rsquo;s call a half-decent DoD one that takes the ticket/story/whatever to at least production. Anything else is DoFD - Definition of Fake Done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the surface the DoFD appears harmless and even a good idea - after all, if deployment is a pain let&amp;rsquo;s just put the feature in a &amp;ldquo;UAT environment&amp;rdquo;, call it done, and move onto the next one while we sort out how to make deployments easier by batching features. This is by far the most common interpretation of a DoD that I&amp;rsquo;ve seen, and it drives some behaviours that are very detrimental to team and software health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, it takes work off the board. A ticket not on the board is work that is not visualized and thus hidden. It is easy to lose sight of all the in-progress work that is marked as complete, which immediately takes developer attention away from the release activities that need to be performed and instead focuses them more on feature work. This separation of concern drives a vicious downward spiral where the more developers aren&amp;rsquo;t concerned about releasing, the less they care about it. Eventually, it results in the creation of a release process which is separate from the development process, even though sometimes the two activities are performed by the same people, just that the former is done in larger batch sizes that cause inevitable grief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, it takes accountability away and promotes the &amp;ldquo;my part is done&amp;rdquo; attitude which is culturally toxic. It defers the often truly difficult part of software development (releasing) to a group other than the people who wrote the software. Rather than the team being invested in figuring out how to release the software to production, they become accustomed to an external entity taking care of this part. This specialization between development and release creates separate accountabilities and is antithetic to the DevOps movement where you&amp;rsquo;re responsible for what you wrote. In plain sight we have taken a hard step backwards to the days of dedicated release management teams which operate on separate cadences than on which the software is written, resulting in increased lead times, higher defect rates, and longer feedback loops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, it increases cycle/lead time. Getting it working on a non-production environment and calling it done results in new work being pulled in while release activities are in progress simultaneously, resulting in higher WIP which kills cycle time. The root cause of why we pull in more work is usually because of one of two things, or both: utilization and specialization. Specialization introduces a gate as work needs to be done by the next person in the chain while the previous one remains unutilized. Instead of pushing the incomplete work forward, we pull new work which fits the specialization of the unutilized person thus increasing utilization, thus giving us a feeling of productivity. In reality, now we have more WIP and thus higher cycle time. The obsession with utilization is a much larger topic and it may be the singular reason why teams struggle to deliver fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, it encourages success theater. Partially done work is one of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://zararsiddiqi.com/2019-07-22-examples-of-seven-wastes-of-software-development/&#34;&gt;biggest wastes in software development&lt;/a&gt; and celebrating it creates a system where we talk about activities and outputs, rather than outcomes. Outcomes can only be measured if our work in in the hands of our customers and &lt;code&gt;FakeDone&lt;/code&gt; inherently and silently promotes the idea of delaying that measurement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if there is complexity in release and distribution activities it is invaluable to have those activities mapped out and for work to remain visible in those states without it being marked as complete. It provides information on which to inspect and adapt on, which is the only way we can continuously improve our delivery pipelines. So, in short, if it ain&amp;rsquo;t in production, it stays on the  board.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://zararsiddiqi.com/2020-02-17-digital-organization/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://zararsiddiqi.com/images/brown-concrete-building-154141.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Supporting structures.&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The digitization of customer experiences is a central focus for organizations. These efforts lead to the creation of new organizational constructs, roles, systems and ways of working which are centered around enhancing customer experience. Whether it be an insurance company digitizing their renewal process or a retailer providing contextual product recommendations, the organizational sub-structures created are quite common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common one is the creation of a &amp;ldquo;digital&amp;rdquo; unit within the organization tasked with solving these problems. The term digital is ambiguous and misleading (what isn&amp;rsquo;t digital these days?) but for the sake of discussion, it&amp;rsquo;s referring to an organizational entity responsible for creating internet-enabled channels for their customers (as opposed to &amp;ldquo;analog&amp;rdquo; ones such as in-person transactions). This structure resembles something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://zararsiddiqi.com/images/digital-org.png&#34; alt=&#34;The digital organization as its own entity.&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center; font-size: .8em&#34;&gt;The digital organization as its own entity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The products being offered by the organization reside in the business units responsible for P&amp;amp;L. These are the core money-making offerings of the organization whose distribution channels have remained largely the same for years. These units have products and owners of those products that are measured by P&amp;amp;L metrics. Without them there is no business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The digital structure is staffed in a more customer-centric approach. This is where experience designers, researchers, agile teams fully equipped with Product Owners navigate the complexities the customer faces in interacting with the core products. Common metrics that are targeted relate to automation, customer service, customer experience and can also bleed into customer acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are two groups that collaborate extensively to deliver customer value, and how well they do so is an indicator of the overall health of any transformational initiative. The digital group&amp;rsquo;s ability to take these products and distribute them over different channels (e.g., web, mobile, IOT) is one of the key activities that delivers the value proposition of great customer experiences. These customer-centric approaches are nothing new - Amazon had an empty chair representing the customer in the room years ago - but now they&amp;rsquo;re widely accepted as being a crucial step in any digital transformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point an organization will either reach the limit of these approaches and run into obstacles that require deeper change. One common one is when the digital organization through its investment in research activities uncovers customer needs that require more than a streamlining of the distribution channels but a fundamental shift in how the underlying product operates. This tension is where transformations can either break through and reach new heights or suffocate under the constraints posed by an organizational structure uneasy with change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, consider the case when customer research in a telecommunication organization reveals that they&amp;rsquo;d like reduced costs even if it meant a lower class of internet service 80% of the time as they only need higher speeds 20% of the time. This customer need cannot be solved without rethinking the underlying product offering. The ability of the digital organization to address a need like this is a non-starter not because it is technically difficult to implement, but because it complicates stakeholdering, product dimensions, forecasting, operational utilization etc. Firms are already benefiting from the digitization and automation of services and tackling this level of problem is the next step in digital transformations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to tackle this problem is to embed the digital component within the product:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://zararsiddiqi.com/images/embedded-digital-org.png&#34; alt=&#34;Digital capabilities embedded in core product groups.&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center; font-size: .8em&#34;&gt;Digital capabilities embedded in product groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This structure is more true to the principle of locality as product units have digital components embedded in them thus simplifying communication.  Decision velocity related to products may be higher as the communication channels are simplified enabling responsiveness to customer needs. At the same time, proliferation of this pattern can cause silos, and digital transformations need to consider the overall customer journey, not the interactions with one specific product. It can be argued that this pattern would take us backwards and encourage empire building through products while taking away from the customer-centric approach that design thinking encourages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question that one might ask is who truly is the product owner. Is it the person enabling the customer experiences through digital channels? Or is it the person who designs the core product offering?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It depends on what the product is and the size of the organization. In a smaller gaming company a product owner (or product manager) may be responsible for coming up with the game&amp;rsquo;s value proposition which would be closely connected with game play and the marketing and distribution strategy. In this case the product owner is &amp;ldquo;backwards integrated&amp;rdquo; with the entire product&amp;rsquo;s development and lifecycle. In a large organization where there is a lot of history of who does what and change (i.e., transformations) are made in small increments, the product owner may not have the capacity, ability or experience to be backwards integrated. This is where dependencies creep in and nothing kills velocity like dependencies. One can view these two cases as points on an autonomy spectrum - i.e., how autonomous (or dependent) are the digital teams designing customer experiences?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easy to say that teams should be autonomous in their decision-making but in complex organizations where knowledge is fragmented and not easily shared, this can be risky. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://firstdoit.com/spotify-engineering-culture-lessons-on-autonomy-and-alignment-e86abe5ebca7&#34;&gt;alignment/autonomy model&lt;/a&gt; is a good way to think about this problem - high alignment/high autonomy is a prerequisite for any initiative where this product ownership duality is present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://zararsiddiqi.com/images/autonomy-alignment.png&#34; alt=&#34;Alignment and autonomy&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center; font-size: .8em&#34;&gt;Spotify&#39;s Alignment/Autonomy model&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the above model the complexity arises when the response to the &amp;ldquo;Figure out how!&amp;rdquo; in the top right requires change that we haven&amp;rsquo;t yet anticipated.  This is an inflection point which presents an opportunity to inspect and adapt the structures we operate in. A learning organization will deal with these moments and make the necessary changes to the way it&amp;rsquo;s organized. Those that don&amp;rsquo;t suffer from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.peterkang.com/the-seven-learning-disabilities-from-the-fifth-discipline/&#34;&gt;learning disabilities&lt;/a&gt; and will try to force the problem into existing structures and will compromise on customer experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no textbook way to organize yourself. I see this as a continuum of where the organization is in its customer experience journey. Early on any model which puts the customer first is better than developing products in silos. Any effort to do any customer research using design thinking techniques is valuable. As products mature and organizations want to take the next step, restructuring to mesh the people developing the experience and the ones designing the product is ideal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The digital organization is a temporary construct, not a permanent fixture.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1470753323753-3f8091bb0232?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;w=1200&amp;amp;q=80&#34; alt=&#34;Image: Unsplash.com&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a pattern of organization sub-structure that has become a warning sign of deeper dysfunction. It&amp;rsquo;s the idea of assembling a team to manage access to an enterprise asset, e.g., a tool.  Common examples of putting a team around a tool include analytics software, API gateways, performance testing tools and application security software. Once you peel back the onion there appear to be two common reasons why this approach is taken:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The way to operate this tool is prone to subjectivity or perceived to be poorly understood&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The tool is provided by a vendor with a complex relationship to manage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of subjectivity in a process is proportional to the desire to standardize it. If there are multiple ways to perform the same task from the same tool there will be a desire to perform them in similar ways. This can be due to perceptions of economies of scale, or more likely, control mechanisms being seen as moderators and drivers of efficiency. All are valid points in theory but in practice they introduce a vast array of dependencies which must be managed, and ultimately result in their own process controls around it. It is tempting to think that usage complexity can be reduced by adding people and process - notably an intake and scheduling mechanism for clients to use. The reality is different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approach creates distance between the clients that seek to gain value from the tool itself. This approach also builds a codependence on people managing the tool rather than increasing knowledge of the offering. This is dangerous. Knowledge decay in the maintainers is risky enough and it is compounded by the structure in place which sees external expertise (e.g., clients, other departments) as poorer in quality of their own. There is also an escalating commitment to the tool built through years of emotional connection. At this point we&amp;rsquo;re entering traditional change management talk where the reluctance to inspect and adapt is overcome by familiarity of the tool - after all, why look for something else when what we have &amp;ldquo;works&amp;rdquo;? When we have trained people, a working process and a standard pattern which has been followed for a long time, the inertia becomes overpowering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the time this is not an internally-built software but one supplied by vendors. There may be a number of elements at play which make the relationships complex: golf course deals, budgeting protocols, customizations to manage, vendor history, and a host of other trade-offs and compromises that form the basis of any relationship. Basically, a lot of hysteresis effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the desire for cost predictability (not necessary, reduction) seems to be one of the main drivers of this approach. Benjamin Disraeli once said that most people will choose unhappiness over uncertainty, and that is often the case here. The unhappiness of the clients voiced through frustration and experienced through delays is accepted as long the general cost of operating the tool is predictable. What is lost in the equation is the organization cost that is incurred on behalf of clients trying to get value out of an enterprise asset. Asynchronous and low-bandwidth communication patterns, spotty knowledge of features, and heavyweight process controls all carry a cost which is not measured, let alone reflected in the cost-benefit analysis when opting for TeamAroundTool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;if-not-this-then-what&#34; &gt;If not this, then what?
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#if-not-this-then-what&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can learn a lot from the open source community in how to manage enterprise assets by focusing on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://opensource.com/open-source-way&#34;&gt;principles of open source&lt;/a&gt;: transparency, collaboration, release early and often, meritocracy and community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people interested in the problem being solved can be spread out across the organization. For example, if Google Analytics is the asset which is being managed then there may be product managers, engineers and visual designers that have a keen interest in the areas of experimentation, visualization and analytics. Collaborating within a community of people who have a genuine enthusiasm of the subject matter and a stake in the outcome is crucial. It is at the intersection of knowledge and interest that we can find curators of these assets and promote meritocracies rather than arbitrary hierarchies. Flat management structures like communities of interest (not a centre of excellence) can take many forms, one of the more popular one being Spotify&amp;rsquo;s guild concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Democratizing the management of these assets is a tough task with people already busy with busy-work. This is not a change that can be made overnight and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_adoption_life_cycle&#34;&gt;technology adoption curve&lt;/a&gt; applies - there will be early adopters that will have the desire to act to improve their current projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bold step here is to be transparent and open the configuration or code behind the asset to scrutiny. This can be a painful step. For example, if SonarQube is a tool that is centrally managed, opening up its rule sets and policies to public scrutiny with an invitation for conversations (the pull requests come later, hopefully) is a good start towards transparency and building trust. Beyond the artifacts of code and configuration, much like how in open source projects the community has a say into the process being followed, so should be the case inside enterprises. This can only be achieved through a desire to inspect and adapt on the process through which collaboration happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TeamAroundTool is a concept that is rooted in centralization being seen as an advantage. That may have been the case when skills were highly specialized, organizational knowledge concentrated and users less technically mature. The changes in all three areas requires us to revisit this organizational sub-structure and flatten it so that the quality of service and the product is up to the increased expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Feature Toggle Design Patterns for Front-End Development in Typescript</title>
      <link>https://zararsiddiqi.com/2019-12-30-feature-toggle-design-patterns/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1556217994-22de7face210?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;w=1236&amp;amp;q=80&#34; alt=&#34;Image: Unsplash.com&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.martinfowler.com/articles/feature-toggles.html&#34;&gt;Feature toggles&lt;/a&gt; have many uses including hiding unfinished work, performing A/B testing and more. One of the most valuable benefits of feature toggles is that it enables &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/devops/continuous-delivery/&#34;&gt;Continuous Delivery&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/&#34;&gt;Trunk-Based Development&lt;/a&gt;, where code is merged into trunk without the use of long-lived feature branches and then shipped safely to production. Feature toggles allow us to differentiate between a deployment and release, the former shipping hidden code to production with no impact to end users, and the latter making those features available to users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The techniques to implement feature toggles on the server side are fairly well-known with good library support out there. On the front-end side I&amp;rsquo;ve observed a tendency to splash if/else statements across the codebase to implement them, resulting in high technical debt and hard to maintain code. The same principles and design patterns that apply in a language like Java also apply in Typescript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve compiled five design patterns which can be used to implement feature toggles in Angular.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Arsenalist/feature-toggles&#34;&gt;The complete source code is here&lt;/a&gt;  - the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Arsenalist/feature-toggles/blob/master/README.md&#34;&gt;README.md&lt;/a&gt; also includes uses cases when one may want to use a particular pattern.  A brief summary is below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An attribute directive which hides content in a template based on a feature flag.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A route guard which implements the &lt;code&gt;CanActivate&lt;/code&gt; interface to turn a route on/off based on a feature flag.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A dynamic component loader which loads a particular component based on a feature flag.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selecting the right &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt; to use inside a component when executing business logic (based on a feature flag).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select the right method to invoke by delegating feature decision query logic to a separate class.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Contract Based Testing with JUnit5, Pact, WireMock and Spring</title>
      <link>https://zararsiddiqi.com/2019-09-19-contract-testing-junit5-pact-spring-wiremock/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 19 Sep 2019 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://zararsiddiqi.com/2019-09-19-contract-testing-junit5-pact-spring-wiremock/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1531417666976-ed2bdbeb043b?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;w=1500&amp;amp;q=80&#34; alt=&#34;Image: Unsplash.com&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contact-based testing allows service consumers and service providers to stay in continuous sync so that any breaking changes are immediately visible.  For example, when a team responsible for designing user experiences (i.e., the consumer) is dependent on the team providing data and services (i.e., the provider), with the latter having many consumers, it is difficult to keep track whether producer changes break consumer applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, there are two types of contract-based testing. The first is where the consumer specifies what the producer service should do, and the other is where the producer defines an expectation on how the consumer should use it. This post is about consumer-driven contract testing which is more relevant in organizations where delivery teams are dependent on internal (and often legacy) systems to consume system-of-record services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://kreuzwerker.de/post/introduction-to-consumer-driven-contract-testing&#34;&gt;This introduction to consumer-driven contract testing (CDC)&lt;/a&gt; is an excellent overview of the problem being addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post we&amp;rsquo;ll implement a CDC using an example of a Furniture UI application which depends on a Furniture Service application. Basically, the Furniture UI just displays the data returned by the Furniture Service. All the code can be found on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Arsenalist/pact-junit5-wiremock-spring-example&#34;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tools we&amp;rsquo;re using are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.pact.io/&#34;&gt;Pact&lt;/a&gt; for defining the contracts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://wiremock.org/&#34;&gt;WireMock&lt;/a&gt; for mocking out back-ends (and as you&amp;rsquo;ll see, help defining our contracts)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://spring.io/&#34;&gt;Spring&lt;/a&gt; to run the UI and service applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://junit.org/junit5/&#34;&gt;JUnit 5&lt;/a&gt; as a testing tool&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/wiremock-pact-generator/src/master/&#34;&gt;This library&lt;/a&gt; which generates Pact contracts based on WireMock stubs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;defining-a-contract&#34; &gt;Defining a Contract
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#defining-a-contract&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We define the contract using WireMock in our &lt;code&gt;UiFurnitureServiceContractTest&lt;/code&gt; class:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we tell WireMock to generate Pact contracts based on any stubbing that we&amp;rsquo;ll do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;@BeforeEach&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;setup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    wireMockServer &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; WireMockServer&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;8082&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  wireMockServer&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;addMockServiceRequestListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;            WireMockPactGenerator  
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;                    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;builder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;furniture-ui-consumer&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;furniture-service-producer&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;                    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;build&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;    
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, we&amp;rsquo;ll define a WireMock stub and then execute some expectations against it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;@Test&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;furnitureTypes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// given  
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  wireMockServer&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;stubFor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;get&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;            urlEqualTo&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;/furniture-types&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;            &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;willReturn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;aResponse&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;                    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;withStatus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;200&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// then

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  Assertions&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;assertEquals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Chairs&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; furnitureTypes&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;1&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will generate a Pact file which looks like the following. The Pact file is the contract both parties promise to adhere to. You&amp;rsquo;ll notice that this looks very similar to WireMock JSON stubs. The reason we&amp;rsquo;re using WireMock to generate these instead of Pact&amp;rsquo;s own DSL is the possible duplication in creating these contracts. If you&amp;rsquo;re already invested in WireMock there may be little reason to expand the toolset to do something which we can already do with ease.  This is made possible by the &lt;code&gt;wiremock-pact-generator&lt;/code&gt; library. So, instead of using Pact&amp;rsquo;s DSL to generate the contract we use the library to generate the contract based on WireMocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    }  
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  ]  
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-will-this-contract-be-used-by-the-provider&#34; &gt;How will this contract be used by the provider?
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#how-will-this-contract-be-used-by-the-provider&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we get to the service code it&amp;rsquo;s important to consider how this contract can be used by the service provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conceptually, the service provider will want to do a few things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand what the consumer expects from it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Execute the tests described in the contract against the provider application to ensure they pass (e.g., respond correctly to the specified requests)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It may choose to do #2 by executing it against the real application or against a mocked back-end, however it sees fit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Point #3 is important as depending on the contract the provider may choose the back-end at its own discretion. If the service is idempotent or doesn&amp;rsquo;t have data implications it may execute against a real service. If it is not then it may just run its own WireMock server and test against that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either is fine, but in both cases it must startup some sort of HTTP or HTTPS server to validate the contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the example below we are using a WireMocked back-end in the provider service to validate the contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;satisfying-the-contract&#34; &gt;Satisfying the Contract
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#satisfying-the-contract&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key annotations on the contract class are as follows. Let&amp;rsquo;s examine both of them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;@Provider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;furniture-service-producer&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;@PactFolder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;../furniture-ui/target/pacts&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;FurnitureServiceContractTest&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;@Provider&lt;/code&gt; refers to the provider specified in the &lt;code&gt;UiFurnitureServiceContractTest&lt;/code&gt; and will be used to query the contract file as there may be multiple providers we may be considering in the same contract.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;@PactFolder&lt;/code&gt; simply refers to the filesystem path of where the contracts were generated by the consumer. There are other ways to define where the contracts are stored but that is beyond the scope of this demo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We next setup a WireMock server to validate the contract. Remember, we could use the real application as well but we just chose the WireMock instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; WIREMOCK_PORT &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; 8082&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; WireMockServer wireMockServer&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;@BeforeEach&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;setup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    wireMockServer &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; WireMockServer&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;WIREMOCK_PORT&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  wireMockServer&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;stubFor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;get&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;                    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;withBody&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;[\&amp;#34;Tables\&amp;#34;,\&amp;#34;Chairs\&amp;#34;]&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;            &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  wireMockServer&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We must now make sure that when the contract is executed it goes against the WireMocked backend (by default it&amp;rsquo;ll hit &lt;code&gt;localhost:8080&lt;/code&gt;) but as WireMock starts on a different port we need the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;@BeforeEach&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;setTarget&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;PactVerificationContext context&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    HttpTestTarget target &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; HttpTestTarget&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;localhost&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; WIREMOCK_PORT&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  context&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;setTarget&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;target&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then it&amp;rsquo;s a matter of reading the contract and executing the tests:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;@TestTemplate&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;@ExtendWith&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;PactVerificationInvocationContextProvider&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;testTemplate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;Pact pact&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Interaction interaction&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; HttpRequest request&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; PactVerificationContext context&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    context&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;verifyInteraction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s it. If you run the tests on the provider you&amp;rsquo;ll notice the following in the logs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;  GET /furniture-types -&amp;gt; 200
testTemplate called: furniture-service-producer, GET /furniture-types -&amp;gt; 200

&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#how-are-you-complicity-in-creating-the-conditions-that-you-say-you-dont-want---jerry-collona&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like this question because it forces you to look inwards rather than outwards on why something might be the way it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lets-flash-forward-to-a-week-or-month-from-this-event-what-would-make-this-a-home-run-for-you-what-does-successful-look-like---tim-ferris&#34; &gt;“Let’s flash forward to a week or month from this &amp;lt;event?. What would make this a home run for you? What does “successful” look like? - Tim Ferris
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#lets-flash-forward-to-a-week-or-month-from-this-event-what-would-make-this-a-home-run-for-you-what-does-successful-look-like---tim-ferris&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;This question forces you to think about the outcomes that you’d like to achieve, the accolades you’d like to receive, the impact that you desire to have. It’s a good goal-setting question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;what-conventional-wisdom-was-shunned-for-this-to-be-successful&#34; &gt;What conventional wisdom was shunned for this to be successful?
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-conventional-wisdom-was-shunned-for-this-to-be-successful&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conventional wisdom suggests to look for patterns and come up with playbooks to replicate what was successful. Success is often a matter of chance and timing, and even success cases would have failed if it weren’t for that. Better questions are what was tried, why or why it didn’t work? Everyone’s path to success will be different, and a playbook by definition is something that has already been played.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;what-is-the-crazy-idea-youre-currently-working-on-that-will-result-in-a-breakthrough-if-its-not-a-crazy-idea-then-its-not-a-breakthrough-but-an-incremental-improvement----peter-diamandis&#34; &gt;What is the crazy idea you’re currently working on that will result in a breakthrough? If it’s not a crazy idea, then it’s not a breakthrough but an incremental improvement.  - Peter Diamandis
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-the-crazy-idea-youre-currently-working-on-that-will-result-in-a-breakthrough-if-its-not-a-crazy-idea-then-its-not-a-breakthrough-but-an-incremental-improvement----peter-diamandis&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;This form of a question can take the thinking from small to big. Framing a crazy idea as a difference between incremental improvements and breakthrough can lead to introspection on where we’re thinking big in the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;how-are-you-trying-to-disrupt-yourself-if-you-dont-disrupt-yourself-someone-will-disrupt-you---peter-diamandis&#34; &gt;How are you trying to disrupt yourself? If you don’t disrupt yourself, someone will disrupt you. - Peter Diamandis
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#how-are-you-trying-to-disrupt-yourself-if-you-dont-disrupt-yourself-someone-will-disrupt-you---peter-diamandis&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal of this question is to make them think about how they have an opportunity to decide their own company’s future before someone else does. If they have the power to assemble people to disrupt them, they should do it. Or accept the status quo as an ideal state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;are-you-thinking-10-improvement-or-10x-improvement---peter-diamandis&#34; &gt;Are you thinking 10% improvement or 10x improvement? - Peter Diamandis
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#are-you-thinking-10-improvement-or-10x-improvement---peter-diamandis&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Framing 10% as something everyone is doing will make them try to separate themselves from “everyone”. Given that x10 doesn’t cost ten times the cash should make them consider going for something bigger than just incremental improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;are-you-having-a-breakdown-or-a-breakthrough&#34; &gt;Are you having a breakdown or a breakthrough?
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#are-you-having-a-breakdown-or-a-breakthrough&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;This can make a person see their experience through a much different perspective. It can get them to see what actions they need to take to take advantage of the current experience.
What is the worst thing that can happen if I stopped doing what I’m doing? And how long would it take for me to undo that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can help change course by making someone realize the risks of change aren’t as big as they may think. And in the event that things don’t work out due to the change, reverting is a realistic, if not easy, step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;what-do-you-understand-about-yourself-and-your-goals-that-the-other-person-isnt-understanding&#34; &gt;What do you understand about yourself and your goals that the other person isn’t understanding?

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;This question forces the person to articulate a difference in understanding of a goal between two people. We often don’t understand ourselves and even if we do, it is difficult to communicate about ourselves to other people.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;When someone is “helicopter parenting” someone they are instilling a sense of fear and doubt into the person, while thinking that they are helping them and preparing them for a difficult situation. By contrast, active encouragement can instill confidence and give them the runway to be brave and take on challenges. The mentor in a relationship must know where they are treading.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;This question puts a person in a position of having to articulate what other people’s perception of them is. Vocalizing this and reflecting deeper on this view can give them an insight into how their behaviour is impacting people. We can also use, “I would hire Chris except for…”. It forces them to think about what people don’t like about them.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of a task it is often not a question of ability but a question of inspiration. Starting small and doing one simple thing to get your heart into whatever you are doing is critical. Once that flow is rolling, the head can organize the outputs of the heart. At the beginning, it is not an intellectual activity but one of volition.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humans have a built-in bias towards not making friends or forming new relationships. Avoiding an enemy is considered more important than making a friend. The cost of mistaking someone for a friend when they are an enemy is perceived to be much higher than mistaking someone for an enemy and them turning out to be a friend (source). Perhaps the recognition of this will help form the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is normal to have a “perception gap” where what people think of you is different than what you think of yourself. We may not be as confident or smart as others may think we are, and when we are admired, it is normal to consider this form of impostor syndrome. These feelings can drive a gap between yourself and someone else as the focus becomes maintaining the persona, and not revealing yourself to have these gaps. This drives a wedge in getting to know someone as we’re managing the perceived gap, and not focused on the true relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a natural inclination to solve issues as they come up, and often the solutions being applied are administrative, e.g., adding a process, documenting something. If the underlying problem is structural, an administrative solution is unlikely to address the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1564517945244-d371c925640b?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;q=60&#34; alt=&#34;Image: Unsplash.com&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dynamically typed languages such as JavaScript allow for implicit interface definitions based on object shape. If you have a &lt;code&gt;Country&lt;/code&gt; object and a &lt;code&gt;State&lt;/code&gt; object which both have a &lt;code&gt;capital&lt;/code&gt; attribute, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to explicitly declare the classes using &lt;code&gt;implements PlaceWithCapital&lt;/code&gt;. You may define the following interface and treat any object containing a &lt;code&gt;capital&lt;/code&gt; as a &lt;code&gt;PlaceWithCapital&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-typescript&#34; data-lang=&#34;typescript&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;PlaceWithCapital&lt;/span&gt; {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;capital&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is very convenient when dealing with data and object definitions that are not under your control. This is not possible in statically typed languages like Java which enforce checks at compile time. Normally this is not a problem but in cases where you are dealing with similar class definitions which are not under your control, it hinders design. The best example is when dealing with SOAP clients which are generated and we usually don&amp;rsquo;t want to be mucking around with generated code. In our example you&amp;rsquo;d end up writing custom code for &lt;code&gt;Country&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;State&lt;/code&gt; despite their similarities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One approach of dealing with this is through inheritance but as with all software development it comes with trade-offs. Here&amp;rsquo;s one way around this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose we want to write a function which prints a capital&amp;rsquo;s name:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;printCapitalName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;PlaceWithCapital placeWithCapital&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;        System&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Capital is &amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; placeWithCapital&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;getCapital&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;d like to pass in a &lt;code&gt;Country&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;State&lt;/code&gt; to this method but currently can&amp;rsquo;t as they don&amp;rsquo;t implement &lt;code&gt;PlaceWithCapital&lt;/code&gt; (since they may be generated or packaged as part of a library and not under our control). One way around this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;CountryWithCapital&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; Country &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; PlaceWithCapital &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;StateWithCapital&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; State &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; PlaceWithCapital &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the extended classes instead of the original allows us to write code such as the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    StateWithCapital state &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; StateWithCapital&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    state&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;setCapital&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Jefferson&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    CountryWithCapital country &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; CountryWithCapital&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    country&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;setCapital&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;D.C&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    printCapitalName&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;state&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    printCapitalName&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;country&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s debatable whether this is a better approach than just post-processing your SOAP clients to &lt;code&gt;implements PlaceWithCapital&lt;/code&gt;. The benefits of this approach are easy to call out - you can now use various design patterns to process data, the code is more testable and we also reduce duplication. There are trade-offs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must use the extended classes instead of the original ones&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the original classes have constructors they need to be duplicated in the faux classes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A secondary point of failure is introduced if original object definitions/naming changes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As we can&amp;rsquo;t write &lt;code&gt;PlaceWithCapital p = new Country()&lt;/code&gt;, it results in nonintuitive code - we must always use the sub-classes but there&amp;rsquo;s nothing preventing us from using the original which can cause consistency issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other approaches to deal with this can be using &lt;a href=&#34;http://mapstruct.org/&#34;&gt;MapStruct&lt;/a&gt; or a similar library to copy the values from original object to your own POJO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day this is a design decision and the main driver that informs whether this pattern is suitable is how much change the domain model has to undergo. If it&amp;rsquo;s just a matter of displaying the data then you can possibly get away with the redundancy. If you&amp;rsquo;re maninpulating the objects or performing algorithms on them then it may be worthwhile to increase the complexity of the software to reduce duplication.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1533873984035-25970ab07461?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;q=80&#34; alt=&#34;Image source: unsplash.com&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teams usually have a list of features that they need to develop. Call them stories, tasks, experiments, product backlog items&amp;hellip;it doesn&amp;rsquo;t quite matter. Basically, code needs to be written for the software to do something. If you&amp;rsquo;re using Scrum or a similar framework you go through this list in somewhat linear order. As you complete Feature A along comes Feature B and you&amp;rsquo;re onto the next thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What gets lost in the mix is time to inspect and adapt on the software increment that is Feature A. By &amp;ldquo;inspect and adapt&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;m referring to the refactoring of the technical artifacts that were created or modified so they are easier to change in the future. It is difficult to write quality code the first time around because your focus is to solve the business problem at hand and get the feature to a functional state. If we are not explicitly allocating time for this inspect and adapt cycle which improves code structure and behaviour, it results in poor quality and defect-ridden software. Test Driven Development when practiced ruthlessly can avoid this. In the absence of that we must explicitly create slack in our schedules to accommodate this care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most projects have slack or &amp;ldquo;clean up time&amp;rdquo;. It just all comes at the end. I find it helpful to visualize slack as the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/COBKEvUp4L8CZ4WcRk2_p3QE0w2rvYvHlVogaQ76ZeW2Y1gWMrGmSzI2j9EIlx8NjT9liJhWcDWYdQ&#34; alt=&#34;enter image description here&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have allocated the same amount of slack in both cases but in the second we are constantly using that slack to improve the software increment we are building.  Though I&amp;rsquo;ve shown both cases taking up equal amount of time, in reality the second approach will result in faster development because the technical artifacts (i.e., the code) is in a much better state to make changes that Feature B and C demand because we&amp;rsquo;re caring for it as we go along. The first approach is best &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/KentBeck/status/1123276841110970369&#34;&gt;described by Kent Beck&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;A plan with no slack is less a plan and more a gestating disappointment&lt;/em&gt;. By the time we get to use our slack in the first approach the code is in such a state that every change is risky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This focus on quality is also the professional approach to software development. I&amp;rsquo;m not referring to some hypothetical ideal of a programmer who aims for perfection. I&amp;rsquo;m referring to being proud of the work you do as a programmer and doing it to the best of your ability. Every programmer should adhere to &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2015/11/18/TheProgrammersOath.html&#34;&gt;The Programmer&amp;rsquo;s Oath&lt;/a&gt;, notably points #2 and #5:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The code that I produce will always be my best work. I will not knowingly allow code that is defective either in behavior or structure to accumulate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I will fearlessly and relentlessly improve my creations at every opportunity. I will never degrade them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Product Managers want to build the next feature without realizing the team has yet to inspect adapt on the previous product increment, it is a programmer&amp;rsquo;s professional duty to say &amp;rsquo;no&amp;rsquo;. If we don&amp;rsquo;t then we are no different than a plumber who &amp;lsquo;finishes&amp;rsquo; a job and leaves a leak in the pipes. Frequent slack at a feature or story-level is the team&amp;rsquo;s weapon which protects against rot from setting in. Needless to say that this approach also keeps your &lt;a href=&#34;https://zararsiddiqi.com/2019-02-12-the-tricky-business-of-managing-technical-debt/&#34;&gt;technical debt&lt;/a&gt; to manageable levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At its root this is a timeless conflict between management who wants stuff done quickly and the team that cares about the quality of what they produce. At this point in computing we have countless examples and empirical evidence where this neglect has resulted in software that is hard to change and eventually needs to be rewritten or scrapped. At any enterprise you can point to at least a dozen furious &amp;ldquo;rewrites&amp;rdquo; that are happening which are making the same mistakes their predecessors did. And I&amp;rsquo;m not referring to stuff written in the 80s or 90s, I&amp;rsquo;m talking about stuff written in the last 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technical debt article linked above goes into how this lack of care slows velocity down. More importantly, this is about professional conduct. In Canada at least, there are no software engineering equivalents to societies like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.peo.on.ca/&#34;&gt;Professional Engineers Ontario&lt;/a&gt; which at least sets a floor for conduct so it is upto the engineers to ensure they are communicating the implications of not having time to improve work. The best argument to management is to reflect this as a cost of change argument, but this is a vicious chicken-and-the-egg cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/E1_P8f7ZYnwOya39MEKcLUb9xQ39lEPkV0pTtswA1r28ybNy2abWycIFcqV331Cr99Hv2k3ReDT9gg&#34; alt=&#34;enter image description here&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point we are the mercy of luck that the right people got promoted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From an engineering perspective it is imperative that we have the courage to not call something &amp;lsquo;done&amp;rsquo; when there are valuable improvements we can make, even if our employer/manager/boss is OK with shipping as-is. Again, much like an electrician wouldn&amp;rsquo;t leave open wiring visible we can&amp;rsquo;t leave code in a state where it will rot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not practice Test Driven Development early on in my career and since I was introduced to the concept many years ago it has fascinated me. The &amp;ldquo;tests first&amp;rdquo; approach ensures that code is defect-free and architecturally sound, which means we never are left facing a &lt;em&gt;moral&lt;/em&gt; decision of calling something that is only functionally &amp;ldquo;complete&amp;rdquo; as complete. The software engineering mindset, especially in large enterprises, has to shift. As a starting point we could create just enough slack in our way of working that we adhere to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/97-things-every/9780596809515/ch08.html&#34;&gt;The Boyscout Rule&lt;/a&gt;: always leave the campground cleaner than you found it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps if we create just enough slack to be able to say that, it can become a habit.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Impactful Refactorings: Replace Conditional with Polymorphism</title>
      <link>https://zararsiddiqi.com/2019-07-23-refactoring-replace-conditional-with-polymorphism/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 23 Jul 2019 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://zararsiddiqi.com/2019-07-23-refactoring-replace-conditional-with-polymorphism/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1477414348463-c0eb7f1359b6?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;q=80&#34; alt=&#34;Image: Unsplash.com&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty years on Martin Fowler released the second edition of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.ca/Refactoring-Improving-Design-Existing-Code/dp/0134757599/ref=dp_ob_title_bk&#34;&gt;Refactoring&lt;/a&gt;. Packed with plenty of examples of code smells and what to do about them, the book is a must-read for professional programmers and enthusiasts. Of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://refactoring.com/catalog/&#34;&gt;many refactorings&lt;/a&gt; described the &lt;a href=&#34;https://refactoring.com/catalog/replaceConditionalWithPolymorphism.html&#34;&gt;Replace Conditional With Polymorphism&lt;/a&gt; remains one of my favourites. I will explain why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve generally observed that object oriented programming is being bastardized. There is a strong tendency for programmers to slap procedural code inside a class and think they&amp;rsquo;re writing object oriented code. I find that following the standard three-layer pattern of Controller/Service/Dao is being seen as &amp;ldquo;doing OOP&amp;rdquo;, and all the other stuff of making sure you&amp;rsquo;re using domain language, encapsulation, distinguishing Value Objects and Entities, etc. falls to the wayside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When coaching teams on writing better code, I can pair with them and execute some of the easy refactorings such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://refactoring.com/catalog/extractFunction.html&#34;&gt;Extract Function&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://refactoring.com/catalog/renameVariable.html&#34;&gt;Rename Variable&lt;/a&gt;, but it&amp;rsquo;s Replace Conditional With Polymorphism which can be used as a valuable learning opportunity. Here are some reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conditionals-are-everywhere&#34; &gt;Conditionals are everywhere
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#conditionals-are-everywhere&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conditionals are ubiquitous. It is common to find code such as the following peppered across code bases:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;user&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;isAdmin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;())&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;	&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// display admin control panel
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;user&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;isSubscriber&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;())&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;	&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// display subscriber control panel
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;	&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// hide all control panels
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The above code is rarely questioned on whether it should be refactored into some polymorphic behaviour because on the surface it&amp;rsquo;s doing nothing egregious.  Three cases are being checked and in most such cases programmers apply a refactoring that puts the three pieces of logic into three private methods in the same class. At that point the class is violating the Single Responsibility Principle and is probably also too long. But because the code is reasonably structured in a procedural manner it evades the eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another type of conditional is checking for errors, especially in global exception handlers. Something like the following is very common:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-typescript&#34; data-lang=&#34;typescript&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;checkForHttpResponseError&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;HttpResponse&lt;/span&gt;) {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;	&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;switch&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;code&lt;/span&gt;) { 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;	   &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;401&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; { 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;		   &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Error occurred: &amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;);
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;		   &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; Error(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Security exception - not allowed&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;);
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;	   } 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;	   &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;500&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; { 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;		   	&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Error occurred: &amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;);
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;			&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; Error(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Oops..our bad, we&amp;#39;re looking into it&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;);
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;	   } 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;	   &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; { 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;	      &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// whew
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;	   } 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;	}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, on the surface this looks like decent code which does the job but once interrogated further about maintainability and extensibility, its brittleness and lack of easy testability is exposed. Examples like these are common in enterprise code bases where pressures of getting stuff out the door means refactoring is an afterthought if even a consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The abundance of such cases and the significant impact this refactoring has on the code makes it a vibrant example of refactoring resulting in more maintainable code. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot here for an coach to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-connection-to-strategy-template-method-and-factory-method-design-patterns&#34; &gt;The connection to Strategy, Template Method and Factory Method design patterns
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-connection-to-strategy-template-method-and-factory-method-design-patterns&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was a little sad to see that many recent graduates haven&amp;rsquo;t heard of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://wiki.c2.com/?DesignPatternsBook&#34;&gt;GoF design patterns&lt;/a&gt;. In my opinion they are timeless and every software engineer should have a grasp on recognizing problems that warrant design pattern consideration. When discussing this particular refactoring the Strategy and Template Method patterns lend themselves well to the solution and serve as a gentle introduction to some of the more nuanced design patterns. Let&amp;rsquo;s cover both. I&amp;rsquo;ll only briefly cover the conversation around Factory Method as that is fairly straightforward. First, the Strategy pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a possible refactoring of the first example by applying Replace Conditional with Polymorphism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;abstract&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;AbstractMenuDisplayer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;	&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;abstract&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;	
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;AdminMenuDisplayer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;	&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// member declarations removed for brevity
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;	AdminMenuDisplayer&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;User user&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;		&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; user&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;	&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;	&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;		&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// display admin control panel

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;SubscriberMenuDisplayer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;	SubscriberMenuDisplayer&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;User user&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;		&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; user&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;	&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;	&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;		&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// display subscriber control panel
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;	&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;PublicViewDisplayer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;	&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;		&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// hide all control panels
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;	&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a number of points to be made here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unit testing is much simpler as we&amp;rsquo;re focused on each view separately&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are true to SRP as each class is doing one and only one thing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are using domain language in our classes making it more maintainable (more on this later)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The client code (not shown above) is down one to two lines (constructor initialization and a call to &lt;code&gt;display()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customization of each view can be done by in the Displayer class or its subclasses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find that last point about customization is where the real value of this refactoring is. Our code is now structured so that new requirements can be easily integrated while keeping reuse high. If a new requirement about a &lt;code&gt;PremiumSubscriber&lt;/code&gt; comes in, we can either extend &lt;code&gt;SubscriberMenuDisplayer&lt;/code&gt; or create a new class. At that point, we&amp;rsquo;ll likely use more refactorings like pushing common methods into base classes but now we are in a position to actually make those refactorings.  As Kent Beck says, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/kentbeck/status/250733358307500032&#34;&gt;for each desired change, make the change easy (warning: this may be hard), then make the easy change&lt;/a&gt;. I find that Replace Conditional with Polymorphism is the change that enables easier future changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Template Method pattern is generally associated with algorithms and the word algorithm can sometimes be scary. To get maximum value out of the Template Method pattern I find it helpful to simplify and generalize what an algorithm really is. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t always have to be a complex flow like invoice processing or tax calculations. It can be any set of calculations or rules that need to be followed, no matter how minimal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we take a simplified view of algorithms and view the second case of detecting exceptions as an algorithm containing two steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log the message&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If needed, throw an exception&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shift in thinking lends itself nicely to the Template Method pattern:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-typescript&#34; data-lang=&#34;typescript&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;abstract&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;HttpStatusHandler&lt;/span&gt; {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;	&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;logDetailedMessage&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt;) {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;		&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;);
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;	}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;	&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;checkResponse() {&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;		&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;logDetailedMessage&lt;/span&gt;();
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;		&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;raiseExceptionIfNeeded&lt;/span&gt;();
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;	}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;	&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;abstract&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;raiseExceptionIfNeeded&lt;/span&gt;() ;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;Status401Handler&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;HttpStatusHandler&lt;/span&gt; {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;	&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;raiseExceptionIfNeeded() {&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;		&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; Error(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Security exception - not allowed&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;);

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;Status500Handler&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;HttpStatusHandler&lt;/span&gt; {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;	&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;raiseExceptionIfNeeded() {&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;		&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; Error(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Oops..our bad, we&amp;#39;re looking into it&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;);
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;	}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;Status200Handler&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;HttpStatusHandler&lt;/span&gt; {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;	&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;raiseExceptionIfNeeded() {&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;		&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// nothing to be done
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;	}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;HttpStatusHandlerFactory&lt;/span&gt; {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;	&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;create&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;statusCode&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;HttpStatusHandler&lt;/span&gt; {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;		&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// return an implementation based on statusCode
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;	}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once again, several points can be made about this refactor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have abstracted away the selection of the algorithm from the implementation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New status code handling can be added easily&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testability of the algorithm has improved&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reusability is better and duplication is lower as common logging code is abstracted into its own method&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To understand the structure of the algorithm we only need to look at one place (the template method &lt;code&gt;checkResponse()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it is the last point that is especially salient. We have centralized the knowledge of how status codes are handled in one area, not across cases in a switch statement. The readability for a future programmer in understanding this algorithm is made easier through this change.  Once again, Kent Beck&amp;rsquo;s earlier comment seems relevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#link-to-domain-driven-design-concepts&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refactoring procedural into object oriented code has clear benefits but one that is often overlooked is the impact it has on naming artifacts. We are now forced to give meaningful names to classes instead of having the full behaviour shoved into single methods. This refactoring forces us to create more artifacts (classes, methods) which we must then name. &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/secretGeek/status/7269997868&#34;&gt;And naming things is hard&lt;/a&gt;. However, if we are working closely with Product Owners or business SMEs, we can get very good insight into what these artifacts should be called. We can look beyond the generic &lt;code&gt;*Controller&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;*Service&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;*Dao&lt;/code&gt; names and think about how we can use business language to describe technical artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first example above, instead of a method which displays menus we are now forced to think about our users as admins, subscribers and the general public. This language would not make its way into the code without these types of refactorings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea of embedding domain knowledge in code is closely related to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design&#34;&gt;Domain Driven Design&lt;/a&gt; which is predicated on basing designs on a model of the business domain and having close collaboration between technical and domain experts to refine conceptual models. Unless we explicitly seek out opportunities to embed domain knowledge into our code there&amp;rsquo;s a good chance we&amp;rsquo;ll end up viewing our system as a black box of features rather than a white box of transparent domain decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refactoring is a continuous exercise and for me the most fun part of the Test Driven Development cycle.  It is both useful and rewarding for me to compare the situation in the code pre- and post-refactoring to see what improvements were introduced and how future changes were made easier. It is in that post-refactoring retrospective that we find many learning moments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Toyota Production System&amp;rsquo;s take on manufacturing processes changed the global automobile market and has been the subject of thorough analysis by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.ca/Toyota-Production-System-Beyond-Large-Scale/dp/0915299143&#34;&gt;researchers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.ca/Study-Toyota-Production-System-Engineering/dp/0915299178&#34;&gt;academics&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.ca/Implementing-Lean-Software-Development-Concept/dp/0321437381&#34;&gt;application of those principles to software development&lt;/a&gt; included a focus on waste elimination which has always fascinated me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thought of doing less to achieve more is beautiful on many fronts, and as I&amp;rsquo;ve gone from engineering to architecture to management to whatever-I&amp;rsquo;m-doing-now, it has stayed with me. The idea of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.ca/Essentialism-Disciplined-Pursuit-Greg-McKeown/dp/0804137382&#34;&gt;essentialism&lt;/a&gt;, i.e., doing less but better is a related one and goes hand-in-hand with the idea that to achieve more and higher quality results, we don&amp;rsquo;t need to work more but we need to eliminate activities that don&amp;rsquo;t bring us value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seven wastes mapped from lean manufacturing to software development are shown below, and there are &lt;a href=&#34;https://dzone.com/articles/seven-wastes-software&#34;&gt;several articles&lt;/a&gt; describing the relationship. I felt that a deeper look at these &lt;em&gt;hidden&lt;/em&gt; wastes is needed because there are many instances of waste beyond the obvious ones that need to be called out. These wastes are hard to spot mostly because they&amp;rsquo;re ingrained in our thinking and we see them as normal. This article examines the key types of waste, provides non-traditional examples so that we may reflect upon them and examine our working environment with a slightly improved lense to eliminating waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The eighth waste which was not explicitly mentioned in the Toyota system but is specific to software development is unused talent, i.e., not utilizing the creativity and talent of the people we have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The below examples are not organized by as I found myself spending too much time figuring out which category they belong to, which was wasteful. The categories are less important than developing a sense for identifying wasteful behaviours and processes so you may work to eliminate them. The examples are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In progress stories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unreleased code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unimplemented designs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;@ignored and slow tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stale Definition of Done&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Definition of Ready as a gate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Large backlogs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Redundant application architectures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over-tasking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of release retrospectives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coupling Peer Review to Pull Requests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interrupting a programmer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Waiting for remote builds to tell the real story&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;I did my part&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Defects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inventory minimization is at the heart of lean thinking. The simplest explanation is that firms should not purchase raw materials unless they plan to use them to produce products in the short-term. Even if the cost of raw materials is lower when purchasing in bulk, the materials lying around on the factory floor have a hidden cost, notably higher cycle time, i.e, the time it takes to go from start to finish. That is the idea behind limiting WIP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a reason that on Kanban boards the &lt;em&gt;In Progress&lt;/em&gt; column is smaller than the rest. It is supposed to limit the amount of work people are spread across. The idea is that we&amp;rsquo;d rather finish 2 out of 5 things than complete 80% of all five things. The illusion of progress when working on five things simultaneously is just that - an illusion. When combined with the Pareto principle that for many things, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes, it implies that even though we think we&amp;rsquo;re 80% through, we&amp;rsquo;re far from done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s walk through an example I think is fairly common. Suppose there is a feature to be developed that requires some analysis, design, development, testing, and some refactoring (assume we&amp;rsquo;re not using TDD). If many such activities are started concurrently, there is a high likelihood that we&amp;rsquo;ll approach the final days of our sprint with all activities in the testing phase. This testing phase might require the use of a shared resource (e.g., an environment, data set, accessibility expert) that can only be used one at a time. At this point we encounter gridlock and the sprint ends while the first of the five items in testing phase, resulting in high work in progress, but zero items completed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrast this approach where available people are reasonably allocated to a single task through pairing or mobbing, which means that the task gets to the testing phase sooner, alleviating the strain on the shared resource, i.e., there is only one item in the shared resource&amp;rsquo;s queue. Once processed, all other things being equal, it can service the next task, assuming people started the analysis of the next task at a logical time. The grounds of this thinking lies in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.leanproduction.com/theory-of-constraints.html&#34;&gt;Theory of Constraints&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/the-agile-weekly/understanding-product-development-batch-size-work-in-process-wip-risk-for-small-teams-f551144ecbb5&#34;&gt;smaller batch sizes&lt;/a&gt;. We have to fight the illusion of many things being in progress as lots of work getting done. In reality, it is the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#2-unreleased-code&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Code developed but not released is arguably the biggest illusion of getting things done there is and a form of yucky inventory. Software needs feedback to be validated and as more code and features pile up in &amp;ldquo;test&amp;rdquo; environments it makes it harder and more expensive to develop new capabilities. I will illustrate this with two examples which I think are common enough to resonate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the management of source code becomes difficult as code is queued in non-production environments. As new features are developed they are created in feature branches spawned off the main line which require a merge at some point. The more unreleased code we have the more feature branches spawned off older HEADs. The cost of the merge increases with every feature branch as the probability of conflicts increases. Integration is also delayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Production fixes which are done off older tagged releases also require eventual merges means increased dependencies and a strict linear sequence of working with code. Slowly but surely you find yourself in a situation where you&amp;rsquo;re begging for a release because the sheer maintenance of code is a nightmare and you just want to move up the commit chain. The amount of time spent on this maintenance is waste and the root cause is code not being released fast enough (one way you might accelerate this is &lt;a href=&#34;https://martinfowler.com/articles/feature-toggles.html&#34;&gt;feature flags&lt;/a&gt; and trunk-based development).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, as amount of unreleased code increases, feedback is delayed. Assumptions about future features pile up and the probability of developing the wrong feature increases. The chance of a team developing the wrong thing is inversely proportionally to the frequency of releases. It is tempting to hold off until you think you have critical mass to release a product feature but the hidden waste in this approach is the cost resulting in the delayed feedback from market and production infrastructure. This applies to technical practices as well because you simply don&amp;rsquo;t know how your stack will behave in the wild. We can try to recreate production simulations in our pipeline but production data sets, user behaviour, usage patterns, are inherently unpredictable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There inherent cost of delay in keeping this inventory is often difficult to measure because it is hidden from plain sight. Applying &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.ca/Principles-Product-Development-Flow-Generation/dp/1935401009&#34;&gt;rigour through economic concepts&lt;/a&gt; can help surface this cost of delay.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wrote about the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/prototyping-can-get-way-software-delivery-zarar-siddiqi/&#34;&gt;idea of designs being tested providing lower quality data&lt;/a&gt; than software undergoing similar tests. Often seemingly sensible activities if not filtered through the hard lense of waste will drain a team. The tendency to iterate over software proxies (like designs) instead of investing the same energy in developing the software can quickly turn wasteful. Prototypes that undergo several iterations without being implemented not only provide diminishing returns but take away from the product delivery capacity. We may feel like we&amp;rsquo;re doing valuable work by moving things around in a wireframe and testing designs, but I posit that we have to be very careful of this activity because it is not yielding software, which is the primary measure of progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visual designs are also a creepy cousin of wireframes and on the surface seem like a valuable activity and a good communication tool to convey how exactly the product should look to the engineering team. However, the same could very well be achieved by activities such as pairing and co-development. The &amp;ldquo;inventory&amp;rdquo; in these situations are usually, sketches, wireframes, visual designs, usually a couple iterations of each. We have come to accept these as normal steps in the product development workflow but upon closer examination one can find many areas where we can eliminate waste by either stopping some of these activities, changing their frequency, or changing the way they are executed. It is relevant to view supporting artifacts like these as partially done work as they are in a queue which when fully cleared ships the product. The smaller the items in the queue, the faster we ship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#4-ignored-and-slow-tests&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commented out or ignored tests are sad. They remind me of an abandoned, dilapidated house, which you&amp;rsquo;re forced to look at every day on your way to work. You can see the hopes and dreams of the test laid out but you can also see, nay, sense the reasons it was commented out. Perhaps it was lack of test data or an environment requirement that wasn&amp;rsquo;t met,or maybe the person who wrote it didn&amp;rsquo;t simply know what they were supposed to assert. In the end they didn&amp;rsquo;t want to delete it &amp;ldquo;just in case&amp;rdquo;, so preserved it like a mummy. Glancing at this test every time and wondering what it is, is waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slow, end-to-end test that fire up Selenium and make assertions by operating at the top of the automated testing pyramid when the same result could be achieved lower in the pyramid (unit, integration) are wasteful. They&amp;rsquo;re slow because they fire up web browsers (even in headless mode), and brittle because they require the entire application to be running and functional before even simple asserts can be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;End-to-end tests have a feeling of completeness to them, but all they give you is a false sense of security, and as soon as tests fail and the commenting/@ignoring begins, you start trusting your tests less and less, defeating the entire purpose of testing and resulting in, you guessed it, waste. The inventory here are test cases, running time of tests, ignored tests, and failed/false-positive tests that you have to keep examining to determine if they&amp;rsquo;re still needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My advice for testing: use end-to-end tests to check resilience and environment availability. For everything else, use unit and integration.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I could&amp;rsquo;ve picked many an option to make a process point but a stale Definition of Done is fresh in my memory so I&amp;rsquo;ll go with this. I saw a team review their Definition of Done at the start of sprint planning and they stared at it like it was an ancient scroll they were trying to decipher. It was written months ago and they kept &amp;ldquo;reviewing&amp;rdquo; it every sprint wondering if they needed to update it. Nobody quite new what they were reviewing or if the words even meant anything anymore, they just knew that they had to review their definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t interject until about five minutes into this exercise and asked whether if we had to create a new DoD today based on what we learned in the last six months, would it be different than what that thing is in front of them. They nodded vigorously and trashed the flipchart and decided to make a new one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This had been a habit of theirs every sprint for the last 10 sprints and they spent at least 10 minutes, which resulted in 10 sprints x 10 minutes x 9 people, for a total of 900 minutes, or a full 15 man hours wasted. It may not sound like it but this stale definition of done is inventory which had to be handled every sprint and resulted in waste. Refreshing this inventory is a good example of waste reduction.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve come across a lot of teams that use a DoR effectively by viewing it as a sanity check on whether something is ready to be developed. I recently drew this triangle to remind a team on the stuff that they may want to think about when interrogating stories and uncovering hidden assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wastefulness happens when we treat DoRs as a gate which must be passed with the same rigour as a Definition of Done. The reality is that as you start working on something you will uncover details that will inform the work and change your perspective on how you might attack the work. The learning delay by not starting the work can compound the schedule delay when it does eventually get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point here is to treat Definition of Ready with a grain of salt lest it become a gate for a team to clear before we add value. Keeping this as informal and conversational as possible has shown to work well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building more cars than you can sell is the classical manufacturing example of overproduction. Applied to software, the &amp;rsquo;extra features&amp;rsquo; waste easily maps to building features that the customer doesn&amp;rsquo;t need.

&lt;p&gt;Developing hypotheses of what you think your customers want, creating an experiment out of that hypotheses, and testing it is what keeps us lean and avoids delivering things nobody uses. As soon as we adopt the mindset of assuming we know what the customer wants and think it&amp;rsquo;s a matter of just building it, extra features creep in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many industries the business plan should be &lt;a href=&#34;https://hbr.org/ideacast/2017/08/when-startups-scrapped-the-business-plan.html&#34;&gt;to not have a business plan&lt;/a&gt; and instead have a backlog of testable hypotheses which guide future direction. In the absence of this we are relying on gut feel (which BTW is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/strategic-decisions-when-can-you-trust-your-gut&#34;&gt;very valuable&lt;/a&gt;) and our biases to guide product decision-making, and this can lead to nobody using whatever you&amp;rsquo;re building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on the uncertainty and competition in the industry, having a long backlog is a highly risky approach which ties you into building unvalidated features. Mellisa Perri&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.ca/Escaping-Build-Trap-Effective-Management/dp/149197379X&#34;&gt;Escaping the Build Trap&lt;/a&gt; is a must-read to avoid this.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not common to see an architectural approach as inventory, and I&amp;rsquo;m hoping this example, even if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t apply to the readers&amp;rsquo;s particular context, makes them keep an eye out for such patterns. N-tier architectures have transformed how we structure applications, but one often sees layering like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// Controller.java 
public List&amp;lt;Employee&amp;gt; getEmployees() {    
    return service.getEmployees();    
}    
  
// Service.java 
public List&amp;lt;Employee&amp;gt; getEmployees() {    
    return dao.getEmployees();    
}    
  
// Dao.java 
public List&amp;lt;Employee&amp;gt; getEmployees() {    
    return entityManager.createNamedQuery(GET_EMPLOYEES).getResultList();    
}  
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The service layer (or business layer) is not doing any processing of the data being returned by the Dao layer, and one has to question this design at least a little. If the middle layer is not applying any transformations, or doing any business processing, what is it&amp;rsquo;s value? Every time we have to return information, we have to create an &amp;ldquo;empty&amp;rdquo; layer just because of habit. This can be argued to be waste even if you subscribe to the indirection principle. I would suggest that this is closer to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it&#34;&gt;YAGNI&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not for a second am I suggesting to eliminate the service layer but am encouraging engineers to question the suitability of architectural patterns to the problem being solved. These classical patterns are ingrained in engineers and it is almost muscle memory that writes this code. Frameworks like Angular provide reasonable (and opinionated) approaches to application architecture, but an engineer has to have their own opinion on the problem they are solving or else waste will follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;9-over-tasking&#34; &gt;9. Over-tasking
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#9-over-tasking&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m split on whether tasking is a valuable activity or Lucifer manifested on a Kanban board. It ultimately depends on how valuable they are to the team, but there&amp;rsquo;s been too many instances of tasks that look like this: develop UI, implement CSS, write unit test, execute tests, etc. There&amp;rsquo;s also the associated confusion on an engineer&amp;rsquo;s face as she scratches her head and wonders if she&amp;rsquo;s actually &amp;ldquo;developed the UI&amp;rdquo;, because let&amp;rsquo;s be serious, nobody just develops the UI without touching the CSS, comes back later to develop some more markup, writes a test, edits the CSS and so on. It&amp;rsquo;s an iterative and cyclical process that when reflected in linear tasks will result in wasteful stand-up chatter, the board not reflecting the work, and most of all, confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These tasks are inventory which needs to be minimized and improved. One of the reasons for creating smaller stories is so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to task and can just get the work done without having to worry about the minutia. Anytime you see an engineer analyze the task board and think even for a split second to themselves what that task is supposed to exactly mean, you are witnessing waste due to high inventory. Eliminate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#10-lack-of-release-retrospectives&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doing things when they don&amp;rsquo;t need to be done is the essence here. Nobody will disagree with that idea but will involuntarily continue to do exactly the opposite. The manufacturing example goes back to the prodcution of motorcycles. A technician used to tighten the bolts on motorcyles and later another technician came to inspect and tightened it just in case. Waste. The simple solution was to put a small dot after you tighten so the next person wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to question quality. In software, extra processing is everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say you implement a supervised ML algorithm which works against a data set of telephone calls into a call center. During feature engineering you worked with call center employees, business managers and customers. After a few weeks of work you delivered something and a few months down the line a new call center related problem came up. If as a team or organization we are not effectively leveraging the knowledge from the previous work we have a broken system with inherent waste. The relearning in this example can take many forms: re-thinking source selection, contemplating feature engineering from scratch, algorithm selection, weighting of inputs, tuning or validation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably the most difficult type of waste to consistently address because we have a habit of moving onto the next thing and not &amp;ldquo;refactoring&amp;rdquo; or learning from our experiences. Most teams will have a retrospective at the end of some feature delivery but the mechanism of translating the learnings into reduction of future work are missing. This topic closely ties to slack in our work and how whatever we do we should inject slack into the schedule so that we can clean up, reflect, improve re-use and make maintainable whatever we just did. The mentality of moving onto the next thing without properly closing out the previous is dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pull requests are a valuable construct in a trustless asynchornous enviornment such as open source development. People work on different things at different times and face-to-face communication is hard to facilitate. Reviewing code in isolation and providing feedback asycnchronously is desired because schedules are hard to coordinate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using pull requests as a code review mechanism in a team working the same hours in overhead. Pull request can be used as a vehicle to merge code into develop or master branches, but the actual peer review of the code can be done using pairing or mobbing. If you&amp;rsquo;re not following those XP practices, simply calling over your colleague so she can review your code is far more effective than submitting a pull request, tagging reviewers and then working through a tool. The high bandwidth of face-to-face communication or screen sharing trumps the pull request/review model every time and avoids the delay associated with asynchronous pull requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;12-interrupting-a-programmer&#34; &gt;12. Interrupting a programmer
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#12-interrupting-a-programmer&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hey, can I steal you for a second&amp;rdquo;. When a programmer is focused on something they do not want to be interrupted. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter how &amp;ldquo;small&amp;rdquo; the question is. Open office spaces have mistaken the ability to distract people for collaboration. One of the many downsides of such workspaces is that it is socially acceptable to tap someone who is in &amp;lsquo;flow&amp;rsquo; on the shoulder to take them away from their work and focus on something that&amp;rsquo;s important to you instead. That break of concentration is costly because the context switch from whatever they were doing to what you want them to do to back to what they were doing is not cheap, especially in engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Half the time programmers are struggling to maintain focus in a visually distracting setting and when they finally are able to achieve it, it&amp;rsquo;s open season on anyone interrupting them. This may seem like an &amp;ldquo;anti-agile&amp;rdquo; thing as we&amp;rsquo;re all about collaboration and face-to-face communication. However, that does not excuse poor team norms. One solution: as a team, agree to use &amp;lsquo;do not disturb&amp;rsquo; flags properly. It can be a Slack status, a sticky-note, dedicated focus time or anything else the team agrees on. This is as much about respecting people&amp;rsquo;s time than it is about wastefulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;13-waiting-for-remote-builds-to-tell-the-real-story&#34; &gt;13. Waiting for remote builds to tell the real story
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#13-waiting-for-remote-builds-to-tell-the-real-story&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teams should strive for green tests on their local machine to always imply green tests on their Continuous Integration server. Put another way, if your build works locally it should work remotely. If there are reasons that this is not true it will result in delays in shipping as programmers will get delayed feedback from the &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This topic is closely related to infrastructure and configuration management because it&amp;rsquo;s usually those two area that prevent this from being true. Differences in local and remote environments give programmers a false sense of success because a push doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean &amp;ldquo;done&amp;rdquo; anymore. Instead it means that they&amp;rsquo;re done their part and it&amp;rsquo;s time to cross your fingers because who knows how those end-to-end tests will work out in the wild! If they fail, see the above waste about brittle tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A closely related topic is pipeline ownership. Often a centrally shared team is the one owning the pipeline and configuring things for teams. This model worked well when there was homogeneity across development teams. However, in a multi-team environment where people are working with different stacks it makes far more sense for teams to own the pipeline and configure it how they see fit. The central team&amp;rsquo;s responsibility can be to empower teams by providing tools and techniques to help teams delivery what they wrote to production.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four words that mean nothing in software development. I am a big proponent of pairing and mobbing to instill a sense of team ownership (and quality), but there are plenty of teams out there that operate in a manner where Programmer 1 does Task A, tells Programmer 2 that they&amp;rsquo;re done. Programmer 2 starts Task B and then they figure out how to make A and B work together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The waste on such team happens through handoffs and delays. The presence of a handoff between P1 and P2 is a sign that programmers may require an upskill or that the work is too big. Only in special cases should we be relying on someone else to do something before we call something complete (I&amp;rsquo;m not going to get into the back-end vs front-end false dichotomy but that&amp;rsquo;s where I would go with this). If there is a separate person who does QA then we have another handoff with another associated delay. Practices like pair programming, TDD, mocked backends can reduce the need for handoffs and thus reduce delays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In cases where this is not possible and a handoff is necessitated, then the delay should be minimized and in sync with the larger system&amp;rsquo;s flow. Examples include someone outside the team being responsible for deployment, an external SME handling exploratory testing, a designer shared across teams, a peer review norm which depends on another team. The list can go for pages and one thing will be common across all items: there is a handoff and an associated delay. The preference is to eliminate the handoff, but if not possible, minimize the delay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;15-defects&#34; &gt;15. Defects

    &lt;a href=&#34;#15-defects&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defects result in context switching. You&amp;rsquo;re working on something and now you have to go context switch to something you were working on a while ago to figure out why the software is behaving the way it is.  It&amp;rsquo;s often time-consuming to setup your environment to emulate the production environment where it happened, get the necessary test data to reproduce it, and then figure out what the implications of code changes are. There&amp;rsquo;s no shortcut here and the antidote here is entirely to prevent defects from happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practices like TDD can result in zero-defect code but it requires programmer discipline and professionalism. If you&amp;rsquo;re not practicing TDD, at the very least we should treat a defect as a learning opportunity by first writing a test that reproduces this defect. Then fix the production code and then see the test go green. This way the defect stays dead and at least you&amp;rsquo;ll know through a failing test that it&amp;rsquo;s returned to zombie state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A defect should also result in some sort of retrospective which figures out how something like this can be prevented in the future. It does not have to be a formal one hour meeting, but some sort of discussion which implicates a practice or process gap should be identified. Agile is ultimately about inspecting and adapting, and the defect is a cue to do both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not thaaat tricky, but it can be. Consider the following contrived Python program which replaces all instances of the lower case letter ‘z’, with an uppercase one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;def convert_z_to_uppercase(word):  
  new_word = &amp;#39;&amp;#39;  
  for letter in word:  
    if letter == &amp;#39;z&amp;#39;:  
      new_word = new_word + &amp;#39;Z&amp;#39;  
    else:  
      new_word = new_word + letter  
  return new_word
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Has the implementation of this simple feature resulted in the accumulation of technical debt? Yes, even though we have satisfied the business requirement, it has. Every time we forego an opportunity to refactor and improve, we have incurred debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have done a very quick and dirty implementation of a business requirement that leaves a lot of room for improvement. However, in the interest of time and speed (i.e., time-to-market), we’ve shoved something to production that works just fine and does the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is absolutely nothing “wrong” with the above implementation, as we have consciously traded off flexibility for speed. For example, if tomorrow we’d want to write a feature which replaced lower case u’s, we’d have some refactoring to do since the above doesn’t handle that. The credit card analogy is a popular one when explaining technical debt: we purchase something we need right now (a feature) with something we don’t presently have (time). There is nothing inherently negative about technical debt, it is simply a trade-off. And trade-offs are at the heart of product development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As engineers, we tend to have amnesia since once code is in production, it’s quickly forgotten as we move to the next feature. If not monitored, over time this debt accumulates and hampers agility. Again, financial analogies work well, as there’s a debt threshold which you can tolerate, beyond which it becomes infeasible. Or from the accounting/finance world, there’s advantages of debt financing (e.g., lower cost of capital) but too much of it and you become insolvent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In software-speak, the cost of capital can be replaced with the cost of speed, i.e., how much are you “paying” to get stuff shipped quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All other things being equal&lt;/em&gt;, the cost of making change to software is linearly proportional to the size of the code base. If technical debt is high, this cost becomes non-linear. This concept is &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.freecodecamp.org/what-is-technical-debt-and-why-do-most-startups-have-it-9a54458daabf&#34;&gt;articulated very well by Trey Huffine&lt;/a&gt; (beware, complexity notation incoming):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*0ybDI_lCNqzh4nAZ8kbKqA.png&#34; alt=&#34;More technical debt = harder to make change&#34;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;More technical debt = harder to make change&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this model, blue is business-as-usual where an average amount of technical debt is accumulated, red is where technical debt is out of control, and green is where the debt is being proactively managed, resulting in lower change costs. This is a model so by definition it’s wrong, but it’s also helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going back to financial analogies, the _interest_ we pay when technical debit is high is the cost of making change. The earlier uppercase example is a good one, because if that function were written differently, for example as the follows, our cost of making a change for supporting the lower case ‘u’ feature would be very close to zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;def convert_letter_to_uppercase(word, letter):&lt;br&gt;
new_word = &amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;&lt;br&gt;
for l in word:&lt;br&gt;
if l == letter:&lt;br&gt;
new_word = new_word + l.upper()&lt;br&gt;
else:&lt;br&gt;
new_word = new_word + l&lt;br&gt;
return new_word&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am skipping a discussion on testing in this post and tests are ultimately what make change safer, and am consciously grouping them as &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceteris_paribus&#34;&gt;ceteris paribus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main issue I find in keeping technical debt to manageable levels is visibility. In software development, wastes are usually hidden and unless we make a deliberate effort to make technical debt visible, we are doomed. Whether it be a TODO in the code, a sticky on the wall, a JIRA ticket, a Github issue, or whatever floats your boat, it is important that it be tracked, even if we _presently_ have no intention of working on it. Capacity inevitability becomes available where previously written code can be improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had an unbelievable conversation some time ago where someone in a very influential position told me that “we have no technical debt” on a product that’s five years old. There are three possible reasons why someone would be under that impression or a similar one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. The team knows it exists but is too lazy to document it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. The team knows it exists but is scared to document it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. The team doesn’t know it exists&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure which of these is the worst but the first is mostly a form of either laziness or management pressure where no time is allocated to such work. Market pressure combined with poor leadership will cause teams to cut corners and the ship-it-at-all-costs mentality kicks in, making debt management a distant thought (along with tests). Most of us have been there, and I certainly have, where the demand for the next feature creeps up before you’ve deployed the last one, leaving little time for reflection. Like a neglectful gardener, the weeds grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second is usually a symptom of management failure (What isn’t?). Management can come to expect perfect code where quality is non-negotiable, even when costs are cut and scope is added. Agile may fight the good fight of inverting iron triangles, but management mindsets (and bonuses) are too often still hinged on success theater where admitting there’s technical debt is seen as failure rather than transparency which can lead to continuous improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third is pure incompetence. Nothing more needs to be said. It forms the red quadrant in &lt;a href=&#34;https://deviq.com/technical-debt/&#34;&gt;this model&lt;/a&gt;, which is a good one to inform thinking about technical debt classification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*1H3Nq-WW0wE2MlaHlz1B_w.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this model, green and blue are “good” whereas red and yellow are warning signs. &lt;a href=&#34;https://hackernoon.com/there-are-3-main-types-of-technical-debt-heres-how-to-manage-them-4a3328a4c50c&#34;&gt;Other classifications&lt;/a&gt; treat it as a function of time, i.e., over time incremental changes and technology changes are bound to introduce staleness and “rot” into your software systems. As massive refactorings are both risky, costly and prone to failure (especially in the absence of tests), having technical debt discussed in the same conversations as new features is a must. Technical debt needs to be a first-class citizen in the product backlog, not something we do when things are slow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have emphasized recording of technical debt which is a matter of prudence, but measuring its impact and consequences is more difficult and can be very subjective. Some concepts like &lt;a href=&#34;https://martinfowler.com/bliki/EstimatedInterest.html&#34;&gt;estimated interest&lt;/a&gt; ask teams to estimate against a mucky and a clean system and measure the difference. This is prone to human error and biases for obvious reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a href=&#34;http://thinkapps.com/blog/development/technical-debt-calculation/&#34;&gt;approaches&lt;/a&gt; which treat code complexity and test coverage as indicators of debt. Even with the help of continuous inspection frameworks like SonarQube, it is difficult to evaluate code quality in isolation of the business context the features are being developed in. That business context is ultimately a pivotal factor in when we pay it back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This business context is important because it indicates the likelihood of change to a particular area of the software, which should be a central consideration when prioritizing technical debt in the product backlog. For example, if you’ve written an inefficient sorting algorithm which is seldom used, awareness is a good enough strategy. But if this algorithm is central to business operations and is a scalability constraint, its classification and treatment is very different. The position in the backlog is a function of the likelihood of change — it’s higher if we need to change that area of the code which supports the business, and further down if the interest rate we’re paying is low, i.e., there is little need to change it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is no surprise that Product Managers who are attuned to their roadmaps, have the technical skill to engage in engineering discussions, and understand the implications of their prioritization decisions are invaluable.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Drawbacks of Pull Request Reviews</title>
      <link>https://zararsiddiqi.com/pull-request-reviews/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 01 Feb 2019 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://zararsiddiqi.com/pull-request-reviews/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is &lt;a href=&#34;https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/&#34;&gt;ample&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://martinfowler.com/bliki/RefinementCodeReview.html&#34;&gt;quality&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/tutorials/code-review&#34;&gt;material&lt;/a&gt; on how to effectively review a pull request. This post is not about how to do a code review but what the purpose of a code review is, how most people do it, what the drawbacks of the most popular approaches are, what other techniques we can use to supplement or replace a traditional review process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main purpose of a code review is to provide feedback to your peers so that the quality of the codebase, and in turn the product being built, is increased, or at the very least, not reduced. When most people say &amp;ldquo;code review&amp;rdquo;, what they mean is that Developer A has created a pull request and Developer B (often more senior) is asking questions and providing feedback on the pull request. This &lt;a href=&#34;https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/&#34;&gt;Google Engineering article&lt;/a&gt; is one of many great resources on how to effectively do such reviews and if you want to dive into the mechanics, go right ahead. There&amp;rsquo;s no need to read any further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will offer some critiques of pull request code reviews and then provide some alternate approaches, and end off with one tip which you can use if you insist on traditional PR reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asynchronism:&lt;/strong&gt; One drawback of the pull request code review is that it is an asynchronous process with feedback between the two parties not happening in real time. The process of creating a PR, reviewing it, providing feedback, implementing feedback, reviewing it again and so on, is inherently wasteful due to the delays naturally built into the process. What could have been a simple 10 minute conversation is spread out across hours or even days in an &amp;ldquo;offline&amp;rdquo; manner. Developers end up communicating via Github rather than face-to-face, reducing the &lt;a href=&#34;http://agilemodeling.com/essays/communication.htm&#34;&gt;amount and quality of what can be communicated&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Browser View:&lt;/strong&gt; From a reviewer&amp;rsquo;s perspective, it is tempting to look at the Github PR and review it through the browser interface. This almost always hides the context of the change with Github showing you diffs of changes rather than a holistic view of the repo. Yes, the reviewer can &lt;code&gt;git checkout&lt;/code&gt; the branch and run it locally, but that is often a bridge too far, especially if the reviewer themselves have a stack of tasks to work on. This missing context hampers the effectiveness of code reviews resulting in blind approvals and not the right questions being asked. The design is obfuscated and line-level detail gets too much attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Too Big:&lt;/strong&gt; I have often seen developers nit pick on a pull request containing three files, but blindly approve ones containing 25 files. PR fatigue is a real thing and as the size of the pull request increases, the quality of the review decreases. Kanban enthusiasts would be quick to point out that there is a direct connection here between limiting Work in Process (in this case, limiting the size of PRs) and quality (of the review). But that is a whole another story. Let me leave it at this: PRs have a great probability of being ignored if they get too big, and way too often developers working on feature branches for days submit PRs that the reviewer can barely understand, let alone have the energy to intelligently critique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Missing Business Context:&lt;/strong&gt; When the reviewer is reviewing code in a PR, they don&amp;rsquo;t have the context of the requirement which the code addresses. The developer developing the feature has full context but his or her work is being reviewed by a person with partial context. The reviewer is left wanting to know more about what requirement the developer was trying to satisfy, so that they understand the design decisions better. We can go back-and-forth in PR comments, review the user story to understand things better, but these are all slow approaches to gain the business context needed to effectively provide feedback about how well the solution addresses the requirement. Our focus in a PR review is mostly about the solution, not the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Context Switching:&lt;/strong&gt; There is a tendency to fire and forget PRs. A developer can create a PR, fire it off to their engineering lead, and start working on the next requirement. A few hours go by and there are review comments to handle, and at this point the developer parks what they were doing and starts addressing round one of the comments. Let&amp;rsquo;s see what&amp;rsquo;s happened here: now we&amp;rsquo;re working on two requirements at the same time and we&amp;rsquo;re context switching between multiple things. This is a productivity drain if I ever saw one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lack of Collective Ownership:&lt;/strong&gt; If you work in an environment where &amp;ldquo;his code&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;my code&amp;rdquo; are part of the lexicon for describing ownership, then this point doesn&amp;rsquo;t apply to you. I have observed that this is an anti-pattern for most cross-functional teams where it is desirable that one person can pick up where others left off. Just by the nature of PRs, the author of the pull request is the one writing the code and the reviewer reviewing the author&amp;rsquo;s code. Although they may communicate via a PR and even get on a screen-share to learn more, the implicit ownership of the code remains with the reviewer and it becomes &amp;ldquo;their code&amp;rdquo; which is being reviewed. If something goes wrong, we look at the person who wrote it, not who merged it in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunk Cost Reduces Refactoring:&lt;/strong&gt; Continuous refactoring and test-first development are table stakes for producing high quality code, but many developers don&amp;rsquo;t follow either. When the lack of test-first development is combined with a traditional approach to PR reviews, the desire to refactor code diminishes as we have to &amp;ldquo;go back&amp;rdquo; and change the code based on any feedback. As time has passed since the change was made and the PR was reviewed, the motivation for both the reviewer and the author to change notable parts of the design is low. It&amp;rsquo;s a classic sunk cost bias where what&amp;rsquo;s in front of you is accepted when a better solution would be available, only because you&amp;rsquo;ve already invested time and effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Waiting:&lt;/strong&gt; This is an obvious one. You create a PR and then wait for the reviewer. Whenever I&amp;rsquo;ve done the &lt;a href=&#34;https://hackernoon.com/7-wastes-in-lean-software-development-and-how-to-prevent-them-7bi3tqp&#34;&gt;Wastes of Software Development&lt;/a&gt; retro with any team, this item is one of the first to pop up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if a Github PR review process is filled with so many issues, what&amp;rsquo;s an approach that addresses this? Before I get to that, I want to acknowledge that everyone learns differently and what may be an effective learning method for some may be terrible for others. However, I&amp;rsquo;ve at this point in my life concluded that pairing and mobbing are far better techniques for providing feedback on code, which also have highly desirable side effects of knowledge sharing, reduced waste, and more importantly, shared code ownership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will not go into pairing as much, much smarter people than me have &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.c2.com/?PairProgrammingBenefits&#34;&gt;written about pairing&lt;/a&gt; and are a Google search away. Sam Fare has written about his &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/comparethemarket/i-did-mob-programming-every-day-for-5-months-heres-what-i-learnt-b586fb8b67c&#34;&gt;experience using mobbing&lt;/a&gt; for a prolonged period which I think describes my experience with it well enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will say this about both pairing and mobbing: it can be uncomfortable to get started because both parties (or more than two in the case of mobbing) receive feedback and share their ideas &lt;em&gt;as they are developing the feature&lt;/em&gt;, not post factum. The volume and quality of communication is significantly higher allowing design decisions to be critiqued in a synchronous manner, and any feedback is implemented right then and there instead of on a delay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of experimentation grows exponentially as pairs can diverge and converge on an idea quickly. They can try different things, compare results and pick the best one. Or they can lay groundwork for what&amp;rsquo;s ahead. For example, it is normal for one developer to be working on a function while another is researching an approach to something they&amp;rsquo;ll face in a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rotational nature of both allows everyone to experience the code rather than be slotted into a reviewer/author role, which tends to puts artificial bounds on the process. Once you bake in short 5-minute retrospectives into the process (maybe every 45 minutes), you get a continuous improvement loop which is hard to beat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lot of people when they try mobbing and pairing will wonder why not do two things at the same time to make things go &amp;ldquo;faster&amp;rdquo;? Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be quicker to have two streams of work rather than multiple people working on one thing? That is a fallacy and an example of local optimization which constrains the larger system. It also leads high WIP, low throughput, an increase in cycle time and delayed integration, which means higher risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did promise one tip when doing code reviews post factum and here it is: review the tests that the author has written first. If the tests don&amp;rsquo;t follow a straightforward setup/act/verify structure and are hard to understand, there is a high likelihood that the design/code is questionable. It isn&amp;rsquo;t the code that goes to production which tells you whether it&amp;rsquo;s well-designed, it&amp;rsquo;s the &lt;a href=&#34;http://wiki.c2.com/?TestDrivenDevelopment&#34;&gt;tests that cover that code which do&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Prototyping can get in the way of software delivery</title>

Image Credit: &lt;a href=&#34;https://mediatemple.net/blog/tips/how-to-use-customer-feedback-to-improve-user-experience/&#34;&gt;https://mediatemple.net/blog/tips/how-to-use-customer-feedback-to-improve-user-experience/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m trying to form a perspective on how we can improve getting feedback from end users, so that it can be incorporated into software products sooner. Infusing design expertise into engineering has always been a complicated topic, especially when you consider the context of popular agile delivery methods like Scrum, which enforce timeboxes and demand that shippable product increments be delivered very frequently. This has very often been in tension with design where activities such as user testing and research take longer cycles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volatile markets and elusive product-market fits result in a high product failure, which concepts like Lean Startup have tried to address with varying levels of success. More so, the focus on experimentation has been high but how best to experiment, and more importantly, where design fits into that experimentation is a quirky topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many different ways to examine this dynamic, and I’ve picked three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design driving the research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design co-developing the experiment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;End-user driving the design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design driving the research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically, designers take on the responsibility of research and user testing, and provide guidance to developers regarding interaction, content, and visual design, which the latter implement. Though product people ultimately make the decisions, the data collected by design researchers inform a lot of the product-level decisions. For example, if user testing based on wireframes show a trend in what users prefer, the product owner is often compelled to follow suit because, well, the data says it’s the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benefit of this approach is that user testing is cheap, and we can get feedback from our users on prototypes fairly early in the process, thus driving product design through end-user feedback. The biggest problem with this is that the quality of data collected from users is questionable. People say they’ll do something and then do something else, and basing decisions on how people interact with prototypes instead of real software is a big risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mindset to revisit prior decisions once the software is ready helps and is aided by agile practices which promote iterations. I find that this is a stop-gap measure to mitigate the risk of poor data quality coming from research activities which are often based on low-fidelity prototypes where another human being is “walking through” the prototypes with another human being. There’s no software in the mix, which means the subject of evaluation isn’t in the room, therefore we keep the door open by calling out iterations. I love &lt;a href=&#34;http://itsadeliverything.com/revisiting-the-iterative-incremental-mona-lisa&#34;&gt;iterations&lt;/a&gt; but also emphasize the quality in each iteration, which seems to be lacking in this approach. When I say quality is lacking, I don’t mean the engineering quality of the product or whether we built the thing right. I’m referring to whether we built the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design co-developing the experiment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach accepts that the reason end users aren’t able to provide high quality feedback is because the software delivery team isn’t able to respond fast enough to testing needs, forcing designers to use faster methods of achieving feedback, i.e., prototypes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this model, the prototype is the software itself, not a mockup or a wireframe. The role of design here is to sit with developers and design the experiment (i.e., software) so that it can be placed in front of users directly. Things don’t have to be functioning, for example, you could have a button called “View Order History” which doesn’t do anything but you’ll get feedback if the user even clicks on it. The larger point is that the user is interacting with the software itself, not a proxy artifact (hint: InVision).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data collected in this setting is of much higher quality because it’s based on what the user is doing, not what they said they would do. The Human-Computer Interaction gap here is as small as it gets, unlike prototypes. Assumptions and constraints come to the fore much faster, but because it takes us a while to deliver software, the lead time to get that data is longer. However, focusing on creating better wireframes is the wrong path to traverse, and instead that investment should be funneled towards creating working software through design-engineering collaboration (as opposed to a mini-waterfall within design and engineering).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is difficult to do because of the waste present in most organizations, but it is very much possible and requires a significant mindset shift of how people work together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A twist on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.behaviormodel.org/&#34;&gt;Fogg’s behavioural model&lt;/a&gt; was taken by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.alexandercowan.com/creating-a-lean-startup-style-assumption-set/&#34;&gt;Alex Cowan&lt;/a&gt; who suggested that people tend to confuse usability for motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see so, so many teams over-investing in excellent usability for a product that it later turns out no one is motivated to buy or use. Usability matters, but I would say motivation matters more at the early stages of a project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find the above borderline profound, and something I subscribe to. The economic cost of designing for great usability is can be very high in an environment where experimentation and user feedback is valued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;End-user driving the design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of &lt;a href=&#34;https://jnd.org/community-based-human-centered-design/&#34;&gt;community-based design&lt;/a&gt; is appealing. In its essence, it’s this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People know what they want better than an “expert” designer trying to understand the people’s context&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give people the authority, tools, and processes to design for themselves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Designers are responsible for facilitating discussions with people, i.e., design-infused, not design-led&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strength of this approach is that, when facilitated properly, it has the power to elicit end-user needs in an unambiguous manner. The major weakness is that end-user’s have the tendency to focus on addressing the symptom rather than the root cause of a problem (hence the need for expert facilitation), which can result in local optimization to global problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is powerful — have the people who have to live with the decisions design the interaction. There is still the issue of people saying what they want and then doing something else, but the difference here is that instead of users picking and choosing between options presented to them, they are creating the options. Their mental models are being directly projected onto what they’re designing, rather than being loosely mapped to options provided by a designer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a preference for the second method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have had the opportunity to work with content, interaction and visual designers, and find their viewpoints fascinating. They make me think of things in a way that I hadn’t thought of before. There are barriers which prevent this expertise to be infused in software, and in my view, a lot has to do with the distance and artifacts present between this thinking and the software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is far more productive and enjoyable for developers to take guidance from designers by sitting side-by-side in creating testable hypotheses. From a designer perspective, the coveted feedback is received that much sooner. The trade-off is the level of usability, which I suggest does not need to be perfected to get directional feedback for the product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, &lt;em&gt;working software is the primary measure of progress.&lt;/em&gt; Everything else is a distraction.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Theory of User Story Sizing</title>
      <link>https://zararsiddiqi.com/2018-08-13-a-theory-of-user-story-sizing/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 13 Aug 2018 21:45:30 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://zararsiddiqi.com/2018-08-13-a-theory-of-user-story-sizing/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*-oHzjIS7ER4d3IvoRlwD4Q.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating small user stories has been seen as desirable for reasons such as easier estimation, scope control, and early value delivery. This idea sometimes encounters friction from product developers (e.g., engineers) who see smaller user stories incurring higher overhead costs such as increased time spent creating documentation, test cases etc. After all, why would you need to split a user story about a contact-us form into three stories about viewing the form, validating it, and then sending the data to an external party? It seems logical to just group it all together. Does creating smaller and smaller stories become detrimental to productivity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is some strong theory and practical reasoning behind when a user story is too small to the point where it incurs higher costs than if it was larger. For that, we have to look at bits of queueing theory and also examine the impact of batch sizes on throughput and cost. There are two important ideas to consider when making such decisions: transaction cost and holding cost. For the purposes of this post, I’ll use the word feature interchangeably with story, and the two can be viewed as the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transaction Cost:&lt;/strong&gt; The transaction cost of completing the feature is time and money spent on the feature such as creating the requirement, developing it, writing unit tests, setting up test data, writing functional tests, and releasing it. Transaction costs can be argued to be economies of scale, as the more features are delivered, the cheaper it is to develop each feature. This is intuitive as costs related to testing, infrastructure, releasing, will spread out over each feature and become cheaper overall. For example, you might automate setup costs for the test suite so that adding more tests to the suite will be very cheap than the first tests that were created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holding Cost:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the probabilistic cost associated with the risk of “holding” features back from development and opting to group them into larger features. This cost could result from increased coupling of requirements, introduction of dependencies, larger features costing more to test, delayed feedback resulting in incorrect implementation, and more. This cost is generally a linear function of feature size which is intuitive, i.e., the bigger the requirement, the greater the chance something might go wrong. Note that it could be argued that this can be logarithmic or exponential, but we’ll stick with linear as it is the least controversial take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visualizing these two costs and adding a total cost curve looks something like a traditional and very familiar U-cost optimization problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*pBlffjxJ-FNoJJstfMtd3w.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mathematically, the total cost is simply:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Total Cost = Transaction Cost + Holding Cost&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some key points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The total cost is a U-shaped function which immediately suggests that there is a sweet spot where total cost is minimized.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The feature being too small or too big results in a less-than-ideal cost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ideal cost (i.e., the ideal size of a feature to develop) is when the slope of the total cost curve is flat. Mathematically, this equates to the derivative of the total cost curve equalling zero.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is relevant to call out that the sweet spot is more of a range than a point, especially in a creative field like software development so we need not be exact in our hunt for optima. The math is detailed but once we slog through it, the theoretical optimal feature size is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*lP7gfSeAIDAamZ9aQbpMNw.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;IdealFeatureSize&lt;/em&gt; is essentially the size of the story. It is unrealistic to think that we can apply such an equation on a day-to-day basis when deciding how to organize work, but there are some principles we can use when informing our judgement on how big we need to make stories. To get a complete view, we need to have an understanding of queue size, capacity utilization, and its impact on cycle time (or throughput), but that’s for a later date. Just looking at the above equation, we can take away a couple things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If holding cost is high, then create smaller stories. This could mean the risk of receiving delayed feedback is high, dependencies are unclear, high-cost resources are under-utilized, time-to-market is important, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If fixed cost of developing a feature is high, then create larger stories. For example, testing is entirely manual and there is high data setup costs. Or there is a high price to pay for a security code scan, so cost needs to be minimized.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Though the equation suggests that larger stories are more acceptable when there are a large amount of features to be developed, the emphasis from a software development perspective should be on reducing fixed and transactions cost (e.g., automating testing, releases) so that we can release sooner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking this a step further, smaller stories also translate to smaller development queues, which in turn translate to better capacity utilization, which eventually influence cycle time. All things being equal, it’s the reduction of cycle time while delivering quality that ultimately matters in software development. If you are interested more on such topics, I highly recommend &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.ca/Principles-Product-Development-Flow-Generation/dp/1935401009&#34;&gt;The Principles of Product Development Flow,&lt;/a&gt; which dives deeper into these concepts with excellent intuitive and mathematical rigor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best gains we can make is focusing on reducing transaction costs, and this is where automation plays a significant role. Automated testing, continuous delivery workflows, behaviour-driven development, and countless other techniques all focus on reducing the transaction cost of feature development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, holding costs are rotating upwards on the graph above, as the cost of not releasing features fast enough is becoming more expensive. Time-to-market is often more important than feature-completeness, which is a source of conflict for developers and product managers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, it benefits decision-making when these perspectives are considered when accounting for feature scope, prioritization, and risk management.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The reason for prep meetings, adding more people “in the loop” etc.</title>
      <link>https://zararsiddiqi.com/2018-04-01-the-reason-for-prep-meetings-adding-more-people-in-the-loop-etc/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Apr 2018 23:46:03 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://zararsiddiqi.com/2018-04-01-the-reason-for-prep-meetings-adding-more-people-in-the-loop-etc/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The reason for prep meetings, adding more people “in the loop” etc. is to spread the accountability of the decision so that in the event that things go south, the blame is spread and you aren’t blamed. Most decisions of reasonable quality don’t require a lot of data points or a tremendous amount of insight. It’s just that the perceived consequences of a screw up are high enough that people would rather prolong a decision until “everybody’s on the same page” while at the same time decreasing the quality and increasing the cost of the decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The underlying problem isn’t that people can’t make decisions or the feedback loops are inherently long. It’s that people often don’t have the safety net to make decisions, because as much as we preach “fail fast” etc., the prevailing mindset is still that you’re expected to get things right in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that things are slowly changing in the face of market pressure, so even big ‘ol behemoths like telcos, utilities are re-thinking just how day-to-day business/decision-making is done.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Model for Measuring Productivity</title>
      <link>https://zararsiddiqi.com/2017-12-16-a-model-for-measuring-productivity/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 16 Dec 2017 01:09:33 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://zararsiddiqi.com/2017-12-16-a-model-for-measuring-productivity/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*EVq-5D-pUCxRP4kCH2DSGA.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/em&gt; this model is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At its core, productivity is a measure of an amount of output divided by the number of inputs used to create the output. That is essentially it. Depending on if you’re an economist, a pharmaceutical plant manager, or a software developer, the numerator and denominator change based on context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving metrics aside, there is a heuristic that we can also use to measure productivity. In this model, if productivity is on one end of the spectrum, danger is on the other. Yes, danger, because the opposite of being productive isn’t to be unproductive, it’s to be dangerously unproductive where you’re “adding” negative value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, this is my model and it is wrong but I really feel it’s only mostly wrong and maybe even partially right. In this model, productivity is defined as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*eGms0skfN7EBoMIxiX0p-Q.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could also replace productivity with value and still have the same effect. Let me state some premises about this before you shoot it down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skill is something we all use to create output. From low-skilled professions such as laborers to high-skill ones such as doctors, we use our ability to create output. This is classified as skill. We all have it in varying degrees, whether it be through education, experience or sheer intelligence. Skill is an input to anything we do, from making a sandwich to fixing a leaking faucet. Without skill, we’d die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laziness is the degree to which one chooses &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to apply their skill. This could be a student not trying in a course they’re taken, or a chemical engineer not performing the requisite testing when certifying a drug. You can argue that not being lazy and being industrious is a skill in itself, but hey, this is my model and I get to do what I want with it. I will concede that there is plenty of literature which suggests that grit is a skill that is critical to success in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As illustrated by the first part of the right-hand side of the equation, all other things being equal, if one is not lazy, they will apply the maximum amount of skill they have. Conversely, and again, &lt;em&gt;ceteris paribus&lt;/em&gt;, if one is lazy, they’ll apply none of their skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have a measure of how much skill there is left to apply, we require a multiplier to get an &lt;em&gt;absolute&lt;/em&gt; productivity measure. Here, I’ve chosen responsibility because if we want to measure productivity across domains, we need a &lt;em&gt;relative&lt;/em&gt; aspect in our model. Responsibility could be defined as the importance of the work being performed, or the impact of &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; having the work done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if you are a police officer directing traffic at a broken stoplight, then you have a lot of responsibility of making sure traffic is flowing or else an accident might happen. If you are a police officer at a generic construction site hanging around because the municipality requires a police officer there for some odd reason, we could probably do without you. The examples are countless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using responsibility as a multiplier makes this model arguably unfair because not everyone is given the opportunity to have the responsibility that would maximize their productivity. That is a fair criticism and one that I am willing to accept. Another glaring criticism might be that even if you have very low skill but have a position of high responsibility, then your productivity measure will be higher than someone with more skill but less responsibilities. I am willing to accept this as well because in this model, even a critical task performed at lower quality is better than a non-critical task performed at higher quality. I know, I know, I’m reaching, but hey, it’s my model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting side-effect of this model is that if you are low-skilled, supremely lazy and hold a position of high responsibility, your productivity/value measure is negative. A good example is a low-skilled forklift operator who leaves the forklift in the neutral gear when going on a lunch break. That’s the danger end of the spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, it’s my model and I’m entitled to making whatever up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming back to day-to-day matters, we always find people who have jobs where they don’t have the requisite skill level, but are responsible for performing duties that are critical to the overall operation. From a technology perspective, you can think of QA analysts who don’t know automation, release managers that don’t understand CI/CD pipelines, or senior leaders who are indecisive. Whether it’s lack of skill or laziness, their productivity/value is being limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It goes without saying that this model is wrong, flawed and even subject to ridicule. However, it does give me a different perspective on how to view matters professionally, and helps me understand why the output of some people is what it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most frustrating aspect for me is when we find people in key positions in organizations, where if they upgraded their skill or were more proactive, could make a big impact on operations. It is a simple and classic &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constraints&#34;&gt;Theory of Constraints&lt;/a&gt; problem which is encountered every day. There is always some part of a structure, whether a person, department, or firm, that if only they had higher skill and greater enthusiasm, they would be primed to make a big impact because they are in a position of great responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By no means is the takeaway here that you should start applying this line of thinking, just that you consider some of the line of thinking applied.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Enterprise Ecosystem Already Exists — They’re called EUCs</title>
      <link>https://zararsiddiqi.com/2017-12-12-the-enterprise-ecosystem-already-exists/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 12 Dec 2017 21:52:12 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://zararsiddiqi.com/2017-12-12-the-enterprise-ecosystem-already-exists/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*gRwCDFm0Zrzng6CDtAHyqQ.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all know of the intern who ended up hacking something over a summer only for that tool to become something of a necessity in day-to-day business. I even know of one business unit which relies on a tool created in Microsoft Excel ’95, which has become so important that a Windows NT machine is still kept around just so it can be run every week. If you’ve worked in business units of medium-to-large organizations, these stories are common. In fact, they even have a name — &lt;em&gt;EUC Hell&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large organizations have two types of technology systems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IT-supported systems which are subject to governance, mapped to cost centers, and maintained by its owners.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unsupported systems built by ancillary departments born of a need that systems in #1 could not fill in a time or cost-effective manner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The desire of technology departments has always been to centralize and control access to lifeblood systems that contain business critical data. This control has manifested itself through business cases, change requests, and other processes which users need to go through before a business need can be fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the low velocity at which technology departments move through their governance, in-take, development, and testing processes, users get impatient and seek quick fixes, which is when the path of least resistance is taken. This can be anything from read-only access directly to the database, a nightly batch job that takes data and dumps it into MS Access, or a screen-scraping tool which keeps the business happy enough so they avoid going through the bureaucratic process of IT intakes. This proliferation is frowned upon and discouraged by technology departments, but has become the norm of doing business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These unsupported tools, also called EUCs (&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-user_computing&#34;&gt;End User Computing systems&lt;/a&gt;), are innovative solutions which solve a very specific problem in a very specific context. They’re narrow enough to be useful, but not flexible enough where they can be reused to solve other problems. Over time, these turn into indispensable and poorly supported applications (e.g., lack of version control, code reviews, upgrade patches) with knowledge concentrated in subject matter experts and interns who’ve plowed away at it over the course of many a summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a change to the supported lifeblood system is needed, EUC integration points are broken, and at this point organizations can either in-house the functionality into supported systems, or maintain status quo by continuing to feed EUCs. This is usually a long and painful political process. The choice of centralization comes with high cost, low change velocities, while the cost of decentralization are unreliable and weakly linked integrations, low quality software, and misaligned development processes across the enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several approaches of how to improve this application topology, and the one that I’d like to focus on is the concept of the ecosystem. We often view ecosystems as independent developers and firms building on top of APIs and platforms provided by Amazon, Google, and the like. They serve as prime examples of the power of platforms in how they enable innovation in existing businesses while creating new and exciting business models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot the enterprise can take away from this model, because as companies grow, the needs of internal users grow with it. Greater collection of data leads to greater curiosity and an organization’s supporting and business units are eager to get at the data. We saw a tremendous push over the last twenty years towards Business Process Management tools to automate, measure, and optimize business processes, and though they come with inconvenient limitations such as steep learning curves, organizations have simply learned to live with them. There are better ways, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://fasterthan20.com/2016/10/building-ecosystems-in-organizations-lessons-from-gap-inc/&#34;&gt;this article which discusses Gap Inc.’s experiences building an internal ecosystem is a worthy read&lt;/a&gt; on how to structure thinking before embarking on creating ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key shift in strategic thinking that organizations should consider is that instead of technology being the &lt;em&gt;provider&lt;/em&gt; of services, it should become the &lt;em&gt;enabler&lt;/em&gt; of services. This is a big shift in thinking because generally technology has followed a very linear process of requirement =&amp;gt; intake =&amp;gt; analysis =&amp;gt; build, with the entire group being a bottleneck for the larger organization’s growing needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the provider structure, technology’s role is to build, curate, and maintain applications which have been approved through legislative process. In the enabler structure, its role is to curate data and expose services which others can build applications on, therefore making EUCs the norm rather than a problem which must be dealt with every few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EUCs have long been the red-headed step child of the enterprise, and their innovative nature has been severely understated. They are always born of a need that, although at times short-sighted, no doubt addressed a very painful problem. As organizations look to be inspired by innovative ideas, the don’t have too far to look. The next step here is to examine these EUCs and see what can be done so people can create more of them, not less. If organized correctly, there is great potential for business units to contribute their own services and APIs (&lt;a href=&#34;http://searchmicroservices.techtarget.com/definition/UDDI-Universal-Description-Discovery-and-Integration&#34;&gt;internal UDDIs anyone?&lt;/a&gt;) where other units can use them, thus creating a networked ecosystem instead of the hub-and-spoke type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are, of course, aspects of governance, security, development support, and knowledge-sharing to name a few that need to be considered. However, if if the principles followed in the Gap Inc. article are followed, it puts the organization on the right trajectory. Three key ones and how they apply here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People and context before process and model:&lt;/strong&gt; Instead of following the process where a centralized entity executes in-takes, does analysis, etc., view the problem through the lens of people who are best able to solve it. Then empower them by giving them the authority, safety net, and the necessary financial resources to execute.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn through the work:&lt;/strong&gt; When diverse units create diverse products, there is a tremendous opportunity to share knowledge and learn about other units across the enterprise. Whether it be software development patterns, tooling, or agile frameworks, there is no shortage of information to be shared. Shortening feedback loops and prioritizing horizontal knowledge-sharing is a necessity for an ecosystem to thrive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Democratize strategic thinking and innovation:&lt;/strong&gt; The people with the best and most innovative ideas are unlikely to be found in management positions. The mechanism to crowdsource ideas and applications needs to not just be promoted, but also supported centrally, similar to a parenting advantage which business units can benefit from. Although business strategies are set at the C-suite level, strategy and innovation should be travelling “upwards” far better than it is today.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next level of discussion would be to discuss models on what the journey of an enterprise is from going to a centralized hub-and-spoke model to a distributed and connected one. That, we’ll save for a future post.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Giving Enterprise Innovation a Fighting Chance</title>
      <link>https://zararsiddiqi.com/2017-11-29-the-art-of-the-estimate/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 01 Dec 2017 18:04:07 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://zararsiddiqi.com/2017-11-29-the-art-of-the-estimate/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*2U67aayRIuoPqgCxT56tIQ.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organizations are facing external pressures which necessitate innovation for long-term relevance, if not present day survival. Traditional business models in industries such as finance, automotive, and energy, are being challenged more than ever, forcing organizations to look inwards for ideas on how to compete. Organizations rely on their human capital to generate ideas which can be turned into either stable business models, or be used to gain a competitive edge in existing models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One popular approach is to download these responsibilities to ground-level teams as they are closest to operations, hoping that ideas bubble up. It’s common to see a Sharktank-type setting used to filter out ideas and fund ones that executives feel carry the most promise. There are plenty of strategy frameworks available to categorize the generated ideas based on temporal relevance and maturity. However, the quality of the ideas is often poor because the people tasked with idea generation do not understand what being innovative entails, let alone come up with ideas. It is not uncommon to see mediocre ideas being paraded where executives have to pick the best of the worst while feigning excitement. If this comes out as harsh, it is intended to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are steps organizations can take to equip teams with the knowledge and context which will result in richer ideas being generated during these exercises:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explicitly describe the organization’s known near-, mid- and long-term challenges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communicate the innovation strategy which describes what innovation means to the organization so people from diverse backgrounds (e.g., technical and non-technical) can participate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide coaching and facilitation services to teams tasked with coming up with ideas, so they aren’t left in vacuum with the pressure of coming up with the next Uber.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communicate the biggest challenges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senior leadership has to openly, honestly and explicitly convey the biggest challenges the company is facing. For innovation to have the biggest impact, organizations have to have their people focus on the most important problems, not just low-hanging fruit. Though quick wins result in confidence and a sense of accomplishment, they have to be balanced with the magnitude of impact the organization is seeking. At the very least, leadership has to convey their view on what problems, if solved, will result in the biggest impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a tendency to under-communicate these challenges by assuming people just know what to focus on. This is dangerous and wastes time because with knowing what the challenges the organization faces are, people’s attention and energies are wandering to non-essential items. There is a argument that we might be constraining people by putting boundaries along their thinking. This is incorrect because what we’re doing here is giving people a true north, rather than putting a box around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some examples of challenges include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Banking: We are losing market share with customers who want small loans, and these are the most profitable customers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Medical: Post-care surveys indicate that patients were unsatisfied with the level of care and attention they received&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Education: The time it takes for graduates from technical programs to find employment has increased by 30% in the last three years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above doesn’t explicitly constrain thinking, but gives an idea of the nature of the problem and forces one to contemplate on what the root cause might be, so that innovative solutions can be designed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A clear innovation strategy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strategy is one of those words that can mean nothing and confuse people if we’re not careful. However, there needs to be an innovations strategy in place and communicated to the organization. The communication part is what’s missing in most cases, because organizations will hire the MBBs of the world to come up with something, but not necessarily communicate its essence downwards, therefore losing any value it might have brought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than regurgitating what an innovation strategy is, &lt;a href=&#34;https://hbr.org/2015/06/you-need-an-innovation-strategy&#34;&gt;this HBR article by Gary Pisano&lt;/a&gt; sums up what the essence of a strategy is. The key takeaway relevant to this post is that innovation can happen on multiple dimensions. Two of the main ones are technological innovation and business model innovation, and that these innovations need to be linked to the larger business strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People in the organization need to understand what the existing business models and technical competencies are, and where their innovative ideas fit in the landscape of the organization — some examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*lF0WGvaBFFc6CyXaL_h4ig.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leadership can decide which types of innovations to focus and allocate resources on based on the business strategy. This allows employees who are tasked with idea generation to have a firm understanding of how their ideas fit into the larger business strategy, and what the impact and implication of their ideas can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on how well the problem is defined also requires what kind of tactical support teams require to come up with innovative solutions. This concept is described in &lt;a href=&#34;https://hbr.org/2017/06/the-4-types-of-innovation-and-the-problems-they-solve&#34;&gt;another HBR article by Greg Satell&lt;/a&gt;, but that discussion is beyond the scope of this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Provide coaching and facilitation services&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are facilitation techniques which can be used to make the most out of brainstorming sessions, instead of leaving people to their own devices. These can range from &lt;a href=&#34;http://retrospectivewiki.org/index.php?title=Retrospective_Plans&#34;&gt;retrospective techniques&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.innovationgames.com&#34;&gt;innovation games&lt;/a&gt;. The point being that an experience facilitator equipped with agile coaching experience can result in a night and day difference between what is produced when a group of people are brought together to problem solve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading between the lines of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.paulgraham.com/startupideas.html&#34;&gt;Paul Graham’s startup ideas essay&lt;/a&gt; offers some basic tips on how a facilitator can structure such discussions. For example, pretend you are living 20 years into the future and try to notice what are the things that are missing. These missing items can be innovations today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ground-level support for teams is critical to an innovation strategy as without it, we are not maximizing the yield of our most important resource: people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innovation is a very interesting topic because there is no mechanical method which guarantees innovation. To date, the best we have figured out is that we need to provide environments and support for people where they have a chance to produce innovative ideas. That’s essentially it. I predict that at some point neuroscience and brain mapping will intersect with what it means to innovate, and in the future we may be able to control and optimize the types of people and processes we need to marry to maximize our innovation output. That is a different story.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Giving Enterprise Innovation a Fighting Chance</title>
      <link>https://zararsiddiqi.com/2017-12-01_giving-enterprise-innovation-a-fighting-chance/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 01 Dec 2017 18:04:07 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://zararsiddiqi.com/2017-12-01_giving-enterprise-innovation-a-fighting-chance/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*2U67aayRIuoPqgCxT56tIQ.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organizations are facing external pressures which necessitate innovation for long-term relevance, if not present day survival. Traditional business models in industries such as finance, automotive, and energy, are being challenged more than ever, forcing organizations to look inwards for ideas on how to compete. Organizations rely on their human capital to generate ideas which can be turned into either stable business models, or be used to gain a competitive edge in existing models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One popular approach is to download these responsibilities to ground-level teams as they are closest to operations, hoping that ideas bubble up. It’s common to see a Sharktank-type setting used to filter out ideas and fund ones that executives feel carry the most promise. There are plenty of strategy frameworks available to categorize the generated ideas based on temporal relevance and maturity. However, the quality of the ideas is often poor because the people tasked with idea generation do not understand what being innovative entails, let alone come up with ideas. It is not uncommon to see mediocre ideas being paraded where executives have to pick the best of the worst while feigning excitement. If this comes out as harsh, it is intended to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are steps organizations can take to equip teams with the knowledge and context which will result in richer ideas being generated during these exercises:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explicitly describe the organization’s known near-, mid- and long-term challenges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communicate the innovation strategy which describes what innovation means to the organization so people from diverse backgrounds (e.g., technical and non-technical) can participate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide coaching and facilitation services to teams tasked with coming up with ideas, so they aren’t left in vacuum with the pressure of coming up with the next Uber.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communicate the biggest challenges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senior leadership has to openly, honestly and explicitly convey the biggest challenges the company is facing. For innovation to have the biggest impact, organizations have to have their people focus on the most important problems, not just low-hanging fruit. Though quick wins result in confidence and a sense of accomplishment, they have to be balanced with the magnitude of impact the organization is seeking. At the very least, leadership has to convey their view on what problems, if solved, will result in the biggest impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a tendency to under-communicate these challenges by assuming people just know what to focus on. This is dangerous and wastes time because with knowing what the challenges the organization faces are, people’s attention and energies are wandering to non-essential items. There is a argument that we might be constraining people by putting boundaries along their thinking. This is incorrect because what we’re doing here is giving people a true north, rather than putting a box around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some examples of challenges include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Banking: We are losing market share with customers who want small loans, and these are the most profitable customers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Medical: Post-care surveys indicate that patients were unsatisfied with the level of care and attention they received&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Education: The time it takes for graduates from technical programs to find employment has increased by 30% in the last three years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above doesn’t explicitly constrain thinking, but gives an idea of the nature of the problem and forces one to contemplate on what the root cause might be, so that innovative solutions can be designed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A clear innovation strategy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strategy is one of those words that can mean nothing and confuse people if we’re not careful. However, there needs to be an innovations strategy in place and communicated to the organization. The communication part is what’s missing in most cases, because organizations will hire the MBBs of the world to come up with something, but not necessarily communicate its essence downwards, therefore losing any value it might have brought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than regurgitating what an innovation strategy is, &lt;a href=&#34;https://hbr.org/2015/06/you-need-an-innovation-strategy&#34;&gt;this HBR article by Gary Pisano&lt;/a&gt; sums up what the essence of a strategy is. The key takeaway relevant to this post is that innovation can happen on multiple dimensions. Two of the main ones are technological innovation and business model innovation, and that these innovations need to be linked to the larger business strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People in the organization need to understand what the existing business models and technical competencies are, and where their innovative ideas fit in the landscape of the organization — some examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*lF0WGvaBFFc6CyXaL_h4ig.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leadership can decide which types of innovations to focus and allocate resources on based on the business strategy. This allows employees who are tasked with idea generation to have a firm understanding of how their ideas fit into the larger business strategy, and what the impact and implication of their ideas can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on how well the problem is defined also requires what kind of tactical support teams require to come up with innovative solutions. This concept is described in &lt;a href=&#34;https://hbr.org/2017/06/the-4-types-of-innovation-and-the-problems-they-solve&#34;&gt;another HBR article by Greg Satell&lt;/a&gt;, but that discussion is beyond the scope of this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Provide coaching and facilitation services&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are facilitation techniques which can be used to make the most out of brainstorming sessions, instead of leaving people to their own devices. These can range from &lt;a href=&#34;http://retrospectivewiki.org/index.php?title=Retrospective_Plans&#34;&gt;retrospective techniques&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.innovationgames.com&#34;&gt;innovation games&lt;/a&gt;. The point being that an experience facilitator equipped with agile coaching experience can result in a night and day difference between what is produced when a group of people are brought together to problem solve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading between the lines of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.paulgraham.com/startupideas.html&#34;&gt;Paul Graham’s startup ideas essay&lt;/a&gt; offers some basic tips on how a facilitator can structure such discussions. For example, pretend you are living 20 years into the future and try to notice what are the things that are missing. These missing items can be innovations today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ground-level support for teams is critical to an innovation strategy as without it, we are not maximizing the yield of our most important resource: people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innovation is a very interesting topic because there is no mechanical method which guarantees innovation. To date, the best we have figured out is that we need to provide environments and support for people where they have a chance to produce innovative ideas. That’s essentially it. I predict that at some point neuroscience and brain mapping will intersect with what it means to innovate, and in the future we may be able to control and optimize the types of people and processes we need to marry to maximize our innovation output. That is a different story.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Framing Back Office initiatives</title>
      <link>https://zararsiddiqi.com/2017-11-22-framing-back-office-initiatives/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 22 Nov 2017 22:52:57 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://zararsiddiqi.com/2017-11-22-framing-back-office-initiatives/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*eaOnIq4lg8hpfB8NulEf2w.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time I hear the phrase “back office”, the image of the Office Space stapler guy comes to mind, which is not great brand association. Projects which seek to eliminate back office inefficiencies are low on the radar of executives because they don’t carry the cachet of competing projects. Hey, would you rather roll out this cool new iPhone app or reduce mortgage approval duration by two days? One certainly sounds like it’s more likely to get you a promotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back office projects don’t get the time of day that customer-facing ones do even though there is customer-facing impact. The CBAs for back office projects are hard to sell because they seemingly don’t pay off enough returns. Three of the main reasons are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are enough surrounding manual and laborious processes in place that automating one of them will not shorten the overall value stream, thus making the project look like local optimization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revenue streams are rarely enhanced and the focus is on efficiency and cost-cutting, with projects showing high pay-back periods as value gets delivered towards the end (e.g., FTE reduction).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a stability and predictability in back-offices that is seen as risky to change, especially when compared with the opportunity cost and risk profiles of other initiatives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we position back office projects so that they are taken seriously? Easy answer is to picture yourself 20 years from now and ask what the level of automation and efficiency needs to be in large organizations as startups and other disruptors apply cost and customer service pressures on organizations with stable revenue streams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customer mobility across competitors is getting more and more fluid with barriers to exit being reduced through softening legislation, reduction in transition friction, and the ever-increasing importance of quality experiences. In this world, inefficiencies will be teased out whether we like it or not. The question then becomes whether we want to tease out the inefficiencies in our firm, or whether we are the inefficient firm that gets teased out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some steps we can take to “sell” back office initiatives to the powers that be. I’ve compiled three and there are many more: 1) avoiding discrete initiatives, 2) emphasizing the value of data, and 3) employee retention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid discrete initiatives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discrete projects which aim to solve a particular problem do not resonate with management as they attempt to resolve only one issue without at least addressing others, leaving you with a feeling that you’re attacking 2% of the problem while ignoring the rest. Contextualizing problems within the big picture helps frame the work so a series of projects can be identified which deliver value through iterations. Yes, part of the benefits will still be deferred till the end until the projects are completed, but there’s no shame in that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve always had a soft spot for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bain.com/consulting-services/digital/digital-transformation.aspx&#34;&gt;Bain’s Digital Radar&lt;/a&gt; as a tool for framing initiatives, and that can easily be adopted to back office management and planning. The link above frames initiatives through the lens of digital transformations, which is perfectly applicable to back offices as much of the work there is around either process streamlining using digitization or automation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emphasize the value of data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CBAs tend to focus on cost efficiencies being gained with primary KPIs including number of FTEs, processing times, etc. These KPIs equate more easily to financial benefits as there is a direct mapping between resource and cost, i.e., optimize the resource and save on the cost. This is a good starting point, but falls well short of how CBAs should be framed when performing benefits accounting for such projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real value is in the structured data that can be collected when digitizing back office processes. The quality and quantity of data that digitization produces in the back office can be mined to reveal insights that are simply not possible through manual processes and archaic tool-sets. What the data collected in the back office says about customer tendencies, internal processes, and revenue opportunities has to be examined. For example, what is the relationship between an HR system processing reference checks faster and potential employees signing on the dotted line? Boring, but useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The true value loss from not sanctioning back office projects is in the opportunity cost of not knowing what the data is telling you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Employee retention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are rightfully focused on customer experiences as they need to be delightful for many reasons. What about the employees, though? A mortgage broker working on an age-old platform painfully keying in customer details is an experience I’m sure he or she would like to avoid. Or how about the closing processes of a bank teller or cashier? The HR associate who has to filter through resumes using poor search functions? These are poor experiences which over time take toll on employees leading to dissatisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These experiences can be delightful and firms can view investment in such back office projects as investments in their employees with a view to retaining them because their life is made easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What level of impact this has on employee retention is unclear to me, but I do know that seamless experiences are attractive and make you want to come back for more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully next time we’re doing fiscal year planning, maybe some of these considerations can creep into our minds as we weigh where to spend our dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reducing friction in structures</title>
      <link>https://zararsiddiqi.com/2017-11-20-reducing-friction-in-structures/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 20 Nov 2017 01:04:07 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://zararsiddiqi.com/2017-11-20-reducing-friction-in-structures/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*69Os6oJ68rUkHX3MUfCCuA.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organizational structures have existed since one caveman told the other to go hunting while he fished. It was a natural distribution of work where resources needed to be organized to produce greater output. Then a third dude strolled along and the first guy asked him if he could make fire. Turns out he could, and he could hunt too, but the thing he did best was to make fire so he was called the fire guy. And so it was that human beings learned to collaborate and coordinate in a flexible manner to achieve something they couldn’t achieve on their own. At its essence, this “organism“ of three people isn’t terribly different than what we today see in complex organizations. Replace skill with fire/hunting/fishing, problem with starvation, and opportunity with a chance to eat, and the basic archetype hasn’t changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key difference is that where structures were forced to change as new skills, problems, and opportunities developed, the modern organization’s default approach is to account for new skills, problems, and opportunities using existing structures. This results in a square-peg-round-hole situation as the current structures were designed to account for a different set of skills, problems, and opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is expensive to change structures and given the aversion to change that people generally have, it’s not a surprise that organization structures rarely change significantly, and if they do, &lt;a href=&#34;https://hbr.org/1995/05/leading-change-why-transformation-efforts-fail-2&#34;&gt;the results aren’t great&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The room for improvement here is vast, and this post isn’t going to pretend to try and solve any problems — we’ll leave that to the expensive consultants. What is far more interesting to me is how the structures exacerbate more than alleviate the very problems they were designed to solve. I’ve picked three to talk about: influence-based networks, wasted talent, and communication quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The influence-based organizational chart&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many structures are put in place so that communication channels are clear and information is shared seamlessly. This formal structure of communication is a starting point, but over time, informal communication structures develop and people figure out how to get things done. Whether it’s chatting up the Linux admin so he can do your firewall change first, to squeezing in an extra feature because you‘re friends with the product owner. This is normal and most collections of people develop these sort of relationships. If something takes 2 days to do formally and 5 minutes to do informally, all other things being equal, why would you not take the 5 minute option? Formal structures, that’s why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time and under the covers, the influence-based organizational chart replaces the hierarchical organizational chart, and if the two are not aligned, it makes for an imperfect marketplace for getting things done. In this imperfect marketplace, the original structure is a hindrance and causes loss of value to the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wasted talent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://dzone.com/articles/seven-wastes-software&#34;&gt;seven wastes of software development&lt;/a&gt; are fairly well-known and rooted in lean principles. There is an eighth one though, and it’s human creativity. Arguably, it is the most expensive one of them all because we go through great lengths to hire people, only to put boxes around them to the point where their true value to the organization is never realized. This rings especially true in the knowledge-based economy where mechanical tasks are rare, and the rigid structures which support them are not needed. This is the classic glass ceiling effect which destroys potential and erodes motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People have good intentions when they place other people under a particular structure, and implicitly trust the structure to promote or bubble up talent. In theory, this is great. In practice, it is very difficult for static structures to adapt to dynamic human beings whose tastes and talents change with time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is hard to believe that the pockets in which people were deployed a year ago remains the best way of doing business, simply because it doesn’t account for an individual’s growth (or stagnation). The restrictions in mobility that organizational structures impose prevent the seamless transfer of skills from one place to another, implying that the people working on activities are not always the best ones to be working on them as there is a good chance there is someone more suited in another pocket who could be better, but hasn’t had the chance to move. This leads to organizational value loss, or if you’re of the economics mindset, a dead-weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communication quality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Structures are often created to make communication easier in the face of growth. The PMP’s famed n (n — 1) /2 communication channels for n people is a scary thought, so we reduce n by creating hierarchies where the “managers” of each team communicate on behalf of the team. Again, a noble idea grounded in reality and practicality. Now complement this with the broken telephone concept, and you can imagine the quality of communication that ends up getting propagated throughout the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My personal favorite is the “prep meeting” where we have a meeting to ensure what we’re going to say when speaking with someone up the hierarchy. This is now considered a necessarily evil because communication has now been reduced to PowerPoint decks (or unless you’re a sick person, Prezi). My view is that there is a risk in communicating upward because face-time with leadership is rare and you want to make sure you get the message right the first time, because communication has become less of a dialogue and far more formal with &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/weasel-words-sales-conversations&#34;&gt;weasel words&lt;/a&gt; dominating the material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are explicit time delays (e.g., biweekly checkpoints) and implicit bottlenecks (e.g., only managers communicating particular messages) which inhibit the overall communication in the structure, even though the purpose of the structure was to improve quality and frequency of communication. Instead, we have surrendered quality and reduced frequency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, so what do we do? We can’t just do away with age-old structures overnight, and even if we did, what would replace them? These are tough questions and very context-sensitive. In a software development context, we’ve played around with extremes — ranging from waterfall to &lt;a href=&#34;https://martinjeeblog.com/2012/11/20/what-is-programmer-anarchy-and-does-it-have-a-future/&#34;&gt;programmer anarchy&lt;/a&gt;, with results all over the map. These are difficult problems to solve because growth asks questions of us which we aren’t always equipped to answer. We don’t know what works and what doesn’t in our context until we have played around with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I suppose that is the underlying point here, once we get feedback from our context (e.g., team, department, board of directors), how often are we willing to change either the structure itself or the content of the edges connecting the nodes in the structure so that structures help and not inhibit. The frequency of this change depends on the cost of change, which poses deeper questions discussed in change management literature. Mostly, how can we reduce the cost of change so we change often? That is for you to decide in your own context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving on to the practical part of this post, three things that I’ve done in large software development teams that I’ve lead to reduce this cost of change are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not have a formal structure until you need one, and make that structure as leaderless as possible, or more correctly, use shared leadership — difficult, but possible. If there’s no predefined structure, then change is inevitable, and it’ll be the type the people feel most comfortable with, not what is imposed upon them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encourage direct horizontal and vertical communication, i.e., just because there is an implicit or explicit leader/manager/whatever, that should not prevent people from communicating with anyone else. If this message is hammered home to everyone, it can have liberating effects on team cohesion and willingness to listen to each other. Apply with caution and always consider your own context.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manage the outcome, not the process. Let people decide on how they want to work, and then manage the outcomes, not the process. You’ll find that given the right set of guiding principles (or goals, or vision), the structures will be flatter and more fluid than what they’d be if you had designed them on paper. This self-organization reduces friction when the inevitable change comes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are difficult problems to solve, and the only thing I know for sure is that solutions need to be context-specific and principles-based. There are no boilerplate solutions here.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Improving architecture decision velocity</title>
      <link>https://zararsiddiqi.com/2017-11-18-improving-architecture-decision-velocity/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 18 Nov 2017 18:37:50 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://zararsiddiqi.com/2017-11-18-improving-architecture-decision-velocity/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*2I5OqDxOy6DwWtUMjsECRQ.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re in a lot better place than 15 years ago when I recall reputable people talking about how software architecture was similar to building a house. That never quite sat right with me because the cost of iterating in construction is insanely higher than the cost of iterating in software development, where agile architectures must iterate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, we have generally accepted that good architectures emerge over time and the severely underrated &lt;em&gt;Refactor=Design&lt;/em&gt; movement has helped people release their strenuous grip on UML diagrams in favor of having real life dictate what software architectures should resemble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s been “upward pressure” on architecture groups at the enterprise level as well, with teams looking to deliver being held back by architecture review boards and the like, forcing the enterprise to reexamine what value architecture is providing. There’s been progress made on this front as well because if not completely agile, the processes governing enterprise architectures have become leaner, and the development team isn’t found left wanting for a decision from the ivory tower before work can begin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one “metric” teams do care about is decision velocity. Agile principles espouse how decisions should be deferred to the latest responsible moment, and agile coaches preach that mantra in order to avoid blockades. However, there are times when the team does need a decision from a higher authority on how to proceed: IBM Websphere or JBoss, Angular or React, etc. The time between when this decision point comes up and when a decision is made is what teams care about, and what architects should also care about. This decision velocity should be considered a productivity metric and a reflection of how well the architecture group is functioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The architect’s value is not necessarily technical proficiency, but a broader view of how these decisions affect the wider enterprise. They need to be equipped with the domain and technical knowledge to make these decisions quickly since the cost of indecision increases with time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big change over time has been that the cost of indecision has surpassed the cost of a wrong decision, and this is where the mental shift needs to take place. For example, when deciding between a security framework like Spring Security or Apache Shiro, the decision to go with either one only to realize later that the other one is more suited may sound like a lot of throwaway work. However, once you weigh the cost of the throwaway work with what would have happened if no decision was made and instead an analysis phase would’ve started while teams waited, it is almost always lower. This is a line of thinking that is yet to permeate fully in most organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, these decisions can’t be made arbitrarily, and require something like a &lt;a href=&#34;http://A%20story%20or%20task%20aimed%20at%20answering%20a%20question%20or%20gathering%20information,%20rather%20than%20at%20producing%20shippable%20product.&#34;&gt;spike&lt;/a&gt; or another form of PoC. Teams execute on such work when implications of the decisions are local, but when they are wider, it‘s when the broader thinking architect is needed, and this is where the major skills gap between old and new school architects lies. Instead of analyzing the product based on documentation, it is far more valuable to test the capability before rendering decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we support architects in making such decisions? My view is that the architecture group needs development capabilities embedded in them, and architecture should be seen as as research group more than anything. Mostly, there is a need to innovate “downwards” so that the architecture is ahead of the curve instead of lagging behind and playing catch-up to what the team has already moved ahead with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of relying on disparate development teams to stream knowledge upward into architecture, the capability of developing new products and processes should be part of the group. For example, as new innovations happen in the continuous deployment space, the architecture group must be ahead of the curve and continuously testing new products to deem fit for the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having these development capabilities present increases the centralized knowledge which can be shared in meaningful ways to teams. One of the best examples I’ve seen of this kind of knowledge-sharing is where the architecture group of an organization, instead of just sharing best practices and guidelines had &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.docker.com/what-docker&#34;&gt;Docker containers&lt;/a&gt; made available to teams who wanted to follow particular design patterns for their application. This sort of practical, centralized knowledge-sharing is rare, and if this level of support is provided to teams, we’ll find that the question of decision velocity goes away, as there is already a framework to make independent but aligned decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>We must recognize unplanned work</title>
      <link>https://zararsiddiqi.com/2017-11-05-we-must-recognize-unplanned-work/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 05 Nov 2017 20:13:40 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://zararsiddiqi.com/2017-11-05-we-must-recognize-unplanned-work/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*e0zTt-9Qa5TaU4gnYO_new.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hate waste. Whether it’s waste of food, time, money, effort, or energy, it annoys me to no end. If there is one thing we should do as a people for humanity, it’s strive to reduce waste. And on a complete tangent, it’s why I liked the final scene in Season 3 of Fargo where V.M Varga used it to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvXhsyNwO8w&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=191&#34;&gt;end the conversation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, I’m referring to unplanned work which continues to be seen as the norm rather than a significant problem. For example, we continue to see major allocations of resources to “production support” which if it’s referring to customer service would be okay, except that it’s referring to people being allocated to solve &lt;em&gt;expected&lt;/em&gt; production issues. If in addition to solving the problem, we ensured it wouldn’t happen again, this would be fine, except we focus far too often on solving the symptom, rather than the underlying cause. The root problem left unattended, will result in more issues, which will lead to more resource allocation, and things will only get worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very recently I asked one of the teams I was coaching on how much time they spent on dealing with production issues. It was close to 40%. I tested this number across a few more teams some colleagues were coaching, and it held true. Back in 2002, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.computerworld.com/article/2563263/it-management/unplanned-work-is-silently-killing-it-departments.html&#34;&gt;Forrester figured it was around 35%&lt;/a&gt; so my 10-minute research is in the ballpark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking a big picture view of this, the “Shifting the Burden” system archetype is a perfect depiction of the problem. Basically, applying the symptomatic solution will worsen the problem, and the only hope of improvement is applying the fundamental solution. Anything else will only increase waste over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*gHneLRX9m6iDaqMJ2Sjffw.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Peter Senge’s The Fifth Discipline introduced us to the System Archetype — Image Source&#34;&gt;
Peter Senge’s The Fifth Discipline introduced us to the System Archetype — &lt;a href=&#34;https://runninginsystems.com/2014/09/17/systemic-archetypes-shifting-the-burden/&#34;&gt;Image Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A basic piece of information that I would encourage every individual, team, department, and organization to measure is how much unplanned work is being performed. Forget about even solving the issues, that comes later. First, we just have to get a sense of how much time we are allocating to work that is not adding value, but is spent on firefighting to maintain the status quo, which may be a pretty fair definition of unplanned work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we go with the conservative estimate of 35%, that implies that 35% of a team’s capacity is wasted and could have been used to add value, where value is a new feature, better performance, experimentation, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at a little more concrete example and consider release management: taking a piece of software and deploying it to an environment (test or production). It’s 2017 and this is still a major problem for many organizations with the time spent on diagnosing why a release isn’t working as expected being a strong candidate for unplanned work. Worst, it’s unplanned work that is now being considered a standard part of the release management process. I will spare you the spiel of how “DevOps”, and its friends like continuous integration, deployment, and automated testing can help solve some of these issues, as there’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/dp/0321601912/ref=asc_df_03216019125208990?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;amp;tag=shopzilla0d-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=shopzilla_rev_444-20;15085253015678018538410080302008005&amp;amp;linkCode=df0&amp;amp;creative=395093&amp;amp;creativeASIN=03&#34;&gt;ample literature&lt;/a&gt; about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, just raising awareness and acknowledging that this is non-value added work is a very, very good start. Here are ten red flags related to release management that indicate you will be doing a lot of unplanned work in the form of trying to debug and diagnose why things did not go as planned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manual coordination is required to ensure the correct sequencing of deployment artifacts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The procedure for deploying to different environments is different&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A human being is being relied upon to test whether a deployment worked&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are network topology differences in the environments (e.g., firewall rules)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is an environment dependent setting in the application configuration file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Binaries are environment specific&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need to wait till next week to deploy a fix because that’s just how it’s always been&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can only deploy on the weekends since a rollback takes more than 15 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using copy-paste to move over configuration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The application and the infrastructure is managed by two entirely different teams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are some basic symptoms of how a team is setting themselves up for countless hours being spent on diagnosing issues that never should have been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice I have not embarked on a “manual deployments are terrible” rant as that is a reality of our world. Lot of organizations have bureaucracies which still inhibit that, but that does not mean we can’t start by recognizing that a lot of the work we do should never be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tying this back to one of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html&#34;&gt;agile principles&lt;/a&gt;, we have to maximize the amount of work not done, and that starts by recognizing how much of the work we do shouldn’t need to be done.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I ain’t got no standards</title>
      <link>https://zararsiddiqi.com/2015-09-09-i-aint-got-no-standards/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 09 Sep 2015 04:44:27 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://zararsiddiqi.com/2015-09-09-i-aint-got-no-standards/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*F-eQahaJCl062e4iEUxe_w.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1789, Thomas Jefferson fired up a letter to James Madison. It was basically the equivalent of a Twitter rant of the time, only that during those times rants had to be coherent, researched, and had to read like op-ed pieces from the New York Times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So &lt;a href=&#34;http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/v1ch2s23.html&#34;&gt;spoke Tommy J&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“…it may be proved that no society can make a perpetual constitution, or even a perpetual law. The earth belongs always to the living generation. They may manage it then, and what proceeds from it, as they please, during their usufruct. They are masters too of their own persons, and consequently may govern them as they please. But persons and property make the sum of the objects of government. The constitution and the laws of their predecessors extinguished then in their natural course with those who gave them being. This could preserve that being till it ceased to be itself, and no longer. &lt;strong&gt;Every constitution then, and every law, naturally expires at the end of 19 years. If it be enforced longer, it is an act of force, and not of right.&lt;/strong&gt; — It may be said that the succeeding generation exercising in fact the power of repeal, this leaves them as free as if the constitution or law has been expressly limited to 19 years only.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep. Deeper than &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOS0J9xtdTM&#34;&gt;Jerry Springer’s final thought&lt;/a&gt;. Imagine that, the idea that an entire constitution of a country is up for questioning after 19 years because times change faster than laws. The idea that policy can never be ahead of practice, and that there’s a pretty good chance that newer citizens of the earth will be in a better position to write the laws that govern them, than people who can’t experience or be impacted by current events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I subscribe to this line of thinking, and before you think I’m suggesting lighting fire to the National Treasure trove of documents, let me be clear that I’m not. I’m just saying it’s optional, and that better options possibly exist. Scratch that, possibly is a weasel word. Better options definitely exist, and people deserve a right to pursue them without having to worry about dogma or violating some arcane law that nobody really understands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The constitution that Thomas Jefferson‘s poking at can be mapped to something very similar in the technology world: standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a word that pops up often enough and never fails to make me cringe. It’s that word that encourages inaction, promotes stagnation, and rewards compliance at the expense of innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with standards is that they’re rarely reviewed with a view to be updated, and once set, they become set in stone and used by architects to thwart enthusiastic engineers who would like to move away from the misery of Ant. There isn’t a developer around that hasn’t tried to introduce an improvement, whether it be a library, pattern, tool, framework, or even a process, only to be told that it doesn’t comply with ‘standards’. It’s disheartening, demotivating, and promotes developer decay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not suggesting that we become aggressive and start updating our toolkits and technologies at the sight of something new and shiny. That would be just as irresponsible as having age-old rules that no longer apply, perhaps even more so. What I am saying is that if there aren’t honest, open-ended, periodic reviews of what technologies, processes, and approaches you’re dictating your IT organization use, then you’re already dead. And by ‘periodic review’, I don’t mean yearly because that’s about as good as never. It should be a hunt for continuous improvement, not a formality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my view, standards can never be imposed top-down. Architects, unless they actually code, are in no position to dictate tooling, frameworks, and the like, because they don’t have to suffer the consequences of the decisions. And as a wise man once said, try not to take advice from someone who doesn’t have to live with the consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standards have to be created bottom-up, and the challenge most organizations face is that they don’t have the culture, process, or know-how of how to cultivate ideas at the trench-level, and bubble them up so they become the new approach. The hierarchical, silo’d nature of organizations essentially kills off any hope of horizontal collaboration and fostering of ideas, and if you’re telling me a monthly developer meeting is your idea of ‘knowledge sharing”, well, shut your company down and open up a lemonade stand because in the long-term it’ll be more profitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The popular, trendy, and mildly smug &lt;a href=&#34;https://ucvox.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/113617905-scaling-agile-spotify-11.pdf&#34;&gt;Spotify approach of organization&lt;/a&gt; is on the right track because it gets rid of hierarchies, promotes inter-team communication, and at the very least, creates a structure where ideas can be brought to the fore and put to vote for adoption. You’re not left waiting for the lumbering architect to peel away from his UML diagrams and start testing out Java 5 so you can finally right a &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; loop without having to track indices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many implementations of the Spotify approach have serious issues because they’ve been adopted verbatim and failed. As with anything, one has to apply the thinking to your specific context. However, that’s a problem with the implementation and not the idea. Most organizations can simply benefit from the concept of a &lt;em&gt;Chapter&lt;/em&gt;, but only if its actually empowered to make lasting change. And that’s where the problem lies. Nobody has an issue if people in horizontals meet to talk things over, but as soon as they recommend a change, the people a level or two higher shiver up and hide because there is absolutely no reason to risk something when things are ‘fine’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incentive to make change is low since the reward systems are misplaced, and the risk of action is too high. Why would an architect risk taking action on a recommendation to switch from Ant to Maven, or from Maven to Gradle, when things are working ‘just fine’? Why would he risk failure when ‘success’ is guaranteed by doing nothing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the intersection of fear of change, misplaced reward systems, and the need to protect yourself through layers of people, lay standards. In most cases, they give the illusion of predictability and safety, when in reality they’re like underwear: needs to be changed frequently lest you risk infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post isn’t going to provide you answers on how to develop standards, and more importantly, keep them relevant. However, I do believe that what we really mean when we say ‘standards’ is predictability and repeatability, both of which are good things. The missing vector in this conversation is continuous improvement. That culture and commitment is what most organizations lack when maintaining standards, and it’s where agile thinking can help. Whether it be retrospectives, unconferences, retreats, or even a lunch and learn, how willingly we view the output of these gatherings and pipe them through a (hopefully simple) process where they can be transformed into a better way of doing things is where the gap lies. The good news is that this gap isn’t difficult to fill, the bad news is that there’s a popular perception that there’s no need to fill it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can block me on Twitter at &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/CornerSniper&#34;&gt;@CornerSniper&lt;/a&gt;. If you haven’t already, do so now.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Phoenix Project, i.e., The Goal for IT</title>
      <link>https://zararsiddiqi.com/2015-08-13-the-phoenix-project-goal-for-it/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 13 Aug 2015 04:06:15 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://zararsiddiqi.com/2015-08-13-the-phoenix-project-goal-for-it/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*2B7p76QgtBP8f5jBulYcfA.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally got around to reading the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.ca/The-Phoenix-Project-Helping-Business/dp/0988262592&#34;&gt;Phoenix Project&lt;/a&gt;, a book that’s quite hot right now thanks to the buzz around ‘DevOps’, a term that is catching up with ‘Agile’ when it comes to being misunderstood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a 345-page read which could have been condensed down to about 10 pages. Granted, those 10 pages are significant and I’ll get to them in a bit, it’s just that I found the author’s desire to mimic the style of the groundbreaking and seminal book, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.ca/The-Goal-Process-Ongoing-Improvement/dp/0884270610&#34;&gt;The Goal&lt;/a&gt;, slightly overbearing. You know, man faces bad situation at work, man neglects personal life, man meets smart guy, smart guy shows man the light, man finds light, smart guy won’t give man all the answers, man eventually finds his own way, man does great at work, man’s wife is happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see where Phoenix Project comes from, you really have to understand where The Goal comes from, because Phoenix is essentially mapping out concepts introduced in The Goal to Information Technology. Or more specifically, mapping it to a large IT department within a large company that’s struggling to support the business objectives of the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Goal, which is all about the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constraints&#34;&gt;Theory of Constraints&lt;/a&gt;, essentially speaks about how your entire system is constrained by a single resource, and exploiting/elevating/subordinating everything else, to that constraint is the way to go, and optimizing anywhere else will lead to waste. AKA: Local optimization is evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re an experienced technology practitioner and you’ve read The Goal, there’s a great chance that as you’re reading it, you’re mapping the concepts and lessons in it to a situation you’ve encountered yourself while nodding your head along thinking how you might view situations differently now that you’re armed with a thinking approach like the Theory of Constraints. If you don’t have extensive industry experience, then at least you might know what to look out for (though I honestly find that you need to fail on a couple projects first to really ‘get’ some of these concepts).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I picked up Phoenix and saw the references to The Goal, I got excited because I felt it would use The Goal as the starting point of discussion, and reach new heights. Unfortunately, that didn’ t happen and the book essentially focused on mapping out IT equivalents of characters/concepts in The Goal rather than offering anything new and groundbreaking. For example, Brent in Phoenix is The Goals’ Herbie — the key constraint that the protagonist has to manage. And that was basically it, the book didn’t really elevate itself to any greater heights than where The Goal left off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless someone struggled to ‘get’ how to map the concepts in The Goal to Information Technology, Phoenix will definitely help make some connections. For me, that alone wasn’t enough to justify the length, or the story-telling format of this read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, there are a some key concepts that Phoenix highlights which are worth mentioning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work groupings and unplanned work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The model of defining all work in four main categories: business projects, IT projects, changes, and unplanned work, with the latter being the most destructive of all as it takes resources away from planned work, which is very bad. Cool concept, nicely articulated with ‘firefighting’ described as the key culprit. I thought this grouping might be helpful for organizations that really do want to classify just where the work comes from so that they can prioritize better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical debt increasing unplanned work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more technical debt you accumulate, the greater the unplanned work you’ll do, which means the less planned work you’ll do. Therefore, keep your technical debt low and regularly invest and improve in your systems, even though there aren’t immediate day-of-deployment tangible gains. Not exactly a new concept, but articulated well nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cater to fragile systems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;80% of the unplanned work might come from 20% of the systems, because those 20% are the most fragile. Pareto strikes again. Change control is a big part of Phoenix, and it’s prescribing that very specific attention be paid to fragile systems that have proven in the past to to cause firefighting, with changes being managed carefully (e.g., CAB and all that). In contrast, low risk work doesn’t need the bureaucratic change processes and can be pushed through. Alright, not bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elevate/exploit/subordinate everything else to your constraint&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether it be that one guy who holds all the knowledge, or that one jump server which serves as a window to your entire infrastructure, identify the constraint/bottleneck and ensure that it’s optimized, used to full capacity, and used in a manner where the work flows through nicely. For me, Phoenix falls short here because, though Brent was the constraint for the Ops team, there was little to no talk of what happens once a new constraint pops up, which is the case more often than not. I thought the situations here lacked depth and didn’t really convey the key point that monitoring and observing your system for the next Brent/Herbie, is a HUGE part of maintaining a healthy system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wait time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept that the time you have to wait on a resource is characterized by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait Time = Utilization Percentage / Idle Percentage&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, for example, if you’re a security engineer in charge of making firewall changes, and you’re 50% utilized, the time someone has to wait for you is 50/50 = 1 unit of time. Or 1 hour, or 1 day, or whatever’s relevant in your context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrast this to if you’re 95% busy, that comes to 95/5 = 19 hours, or 19 days etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slack is something that most agile practitioners insist be present in all situations and Phoenix goes some way in trying to highlight that. Again, just like its coverage of finding the next constraint, Phoenix doesn’t quite dive deeper into this topic which I would’ve loved to read about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pulling work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also the usual Kanban stuff of identifying work centers, repeatable procedures and how each work center has man, materials, method and machine associated with it, but that’s fairly basic stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Three ways”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The principles that Phoenix recommends be present in any organization is summarized in the “three ways”. The first suggests taking a Systems Thinking approach of looking at the flow of work, rather than optimizing locally. The second is about shortening your feedback loops at all levels, and the third is valuing learning, experimentation, and mastery. Somewhere in there you’ll find messages that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.ca/The-Fifth-Discipline-Practice-Organization/dp/0385517254&#34;&gt;Senge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.ca/Drive-Surprising-Truth-About-Motivates/dp/1594484805&#34;&gt;Pink&lt;/a&gt; have been preaching for decades/years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I thought Phoenix is an executive-level read which might spark a thought or two at the right levels an organization, and is one of those books that gets passed down for all employees to read, subsequently collecting dusts in the third drawer next to the broken staplers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m glad I read it, though I felt like there wasn’t enough emphasis on organizational culture which in my view is the connective tissue that makes everything else tick. It just felt like I was reading a diluted version of The Goal.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Let&#39;s retire Agile</title>
      <link>https://zararsiddiqi.com/2015-06-03-lets-retire-agile/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 03 Jun 2015 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://zararsiddiqi.com/2015-06-03-lets-retire-agile/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://miro.medium.com/max/1050/1*GfVaTQwSq53IB1AbDX-6tQ.png&#34; alt=&#34;Thomas Paine&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poor agile. It started off with good intentions rooted in simplicity and common sense. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t long before it got productized, scaled, enhanced, sold, bought, and a few years later agile became Agile. The difference is only the case of one letter, but that betrays just how drastically different the two are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main victim and perpetrator of this crime remain organizations looking for a quick fix to solve deep-rooted problems, who turn to Agile as a way to make things better, faster, and cheaper, without ever willing to take a look in the mirror and truly change. They buy Agile because somebody sold it to them as the solution to their problems, and worst, they sold it as an easy solution. In reality, they just agreed to put lipstick on a pig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lipstick is a nice one - big rooms with whiteboards everywhere, a fresh installation of JIRA, daily meetings, promises of biweekly software - it&amp;rsquo;s hard to argue with any of this. The pig, though, is everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s in Vendor Management where a contract takes months to get signed, it&amp;rsquo;s with Finance which needs a detailed plan before they give you money, it&amp;rsquo;s in Infrastructure where a server needs 12 forms to be filled before it can be commissioned, it&amp;rsquo;s in the hierarchical structure so entrenched in the organization that waste is not only accepted, but encouraged because it&amp;rsquo;s never identified as such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter what kind of a team you assemble, no matter what methodology you use, it won&amp;rsquo;t work if it has to operate in the context of the pig. The constraint isn&amp;rsquo;t the team executing the project at the ground-level, it&amp;rsquo;s the &amp;lsquo;supporting&amp;rsquo; structure that imposes arbitrary rules and processes that hamper software delivery, which ironically they&amp;rsquo;re supposed to help with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When projects do invariably fail, nobody will look at the pig because that would pose uncomfortable questions regarding status, relevance, and change. Being agile would mean to stare these questions in the face and make the necessary change, but Agile says otherwise. The latter affords you the chance to continue working mechanically under rules that are supposed to work, while you continue to struggle in an uphill battle against the immovable and uncompromising pig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere along the way the proposal of using common sense in software projects (agile) got confused with a rigid, monolithic process (Agile). Unfortunately, agile and Agile are now synonymous and there aren&amp;rsquo;t enough well-meaning coaches in the world that can fix that. You can&amp;rsquo;t suggest being agile to someone without them rolling their eyes, but if you ask them to use common sense, it might move them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, let&amp;rsquo;s stop using agile because it&amp;rsquo;s now taken to mean Agile, and nobody wants Agile. It&amp;rsquo;s about as attractive a term as Enron is in the energy industry, and nobody wants any part of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Call it what it is, call it honesty and common sense. All lower case.&lt;/p&gt;
