Good [Continous Delivery podcast](https://continuousdeliverypodcast.buzzsprout.com/883858/8257974-ep-45-evaluating-metrics) where they talked about how to evaluate metrics and their suitability to the situation.

- If you don't know how to respond to a metric, don't measure it. This is a quote from [How to Measure Anything](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/444653.How_to_Measure_Anything)) and is a clever way of asking why we need to measure something. If we're not willing to act when we see a metric, what's the point? 
- If there is additional work needed to create the metric and it isn't a natural byproduct of the work, then we have to ask the question whether the effort of creating an observable metric is worth the opportunity cost?
- Is the metic at the right level of granularity? If a team metric is shown to management or vice-versa, what effects will it have? Will it send the wrong signals which can snowball into waste?
- Is the metric measuring output or outcome? Pure ouput metrics like Line of Code are not helpful. Metrics such as subscribers gained or software quality which are outcome-oriented are better.
- Is the metric being observed producing the right behavours? If people are incentivized to do the wrong thing by the metric then it's harmful.
