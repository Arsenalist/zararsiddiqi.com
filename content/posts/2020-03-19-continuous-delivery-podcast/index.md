I've always been fortunate to have worked with people who had more experience and knowledge than me. Some of these mentors include [Dennis Grant](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dennis-grant-9a49175/) who showed me what Object Oriented Programming truly meant, [Haroon Rafique](https://sessionize.com/haroon-rafique/) who taught me how to be a professional programmer, [Rob Lokinger](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rob-lokinger-5b9253/) who taught me about people and [Mark Samson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marksamson/) who coached me on delivery.

Currently I'm colleagues with [Csaba Bereczki](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cbereczki/), [Gino Marckx](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ginomarckx/) (who I worked with at EPAM as well) and [Jeff Morgan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffmorgan5/), some of the best coaches in the industry. All of us share a passion for Continuous Delivery. 

To make the most of this opportunity and make some memories we started a podcast a few weeks back. It is short, packed with content, and unrehearsed. We aim to keep it between 15-20 minutes.  You can listen to the episodes [here](https://continuousdeliverypodcast.buzzsprout.com/) or you can download the podcast from wherever you get your podcasts. Here are links to some directories:
